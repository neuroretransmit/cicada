# 4chan post before Cicada

Some solvers believed this was Cicada related due to "THE KEY IS ALL AROUND YOU". It is not. Don't spin your gears, it's a huge troll and don't let anyone in IRC/Discord tell you differently.

There is a RAR appended to the PNG that is password protected - the password is...

This results in `the next step` which is also a PNG.

## Chat logs describing this

Scrubbed for brevity.

```
*
3301 is or was an actual organization existing years before the puzzles, however small they may have been at that time (or now)
but also, shit be hard
*
Yeah theres pretty clear evidence that they existed under the name 3301, theres a pre cicada puzzle also claiming it to be a recruiting tool that was found. It is from 2008 and uses some of the same phrasing as the cicada puzzles
*
it's signed 3301
and it is using the same methods and wording. The odds of a completely different group using the name 3301, using a puzzle for recruiting, and using the same wording is so over the top absurd.
*
oh and the file names use prime numbers.
*
Oh I never knew about one that is signed. I think *(?) shared one that wasn't signed but was still suspected to belong to them
*
either the post that it originated on or the data extracted says '3301' at the bottom. its not pgp signed.
*
Yeah the inclusion of “the key is all around you” is certainly conspicuous
*
then the 3301 mention is in the data within, i cant remember what step to be honest,
now i know when * sent it to me ateast, november 2019
*
and 2006 not 2008, sorry
*
It'll be inside the zlib
