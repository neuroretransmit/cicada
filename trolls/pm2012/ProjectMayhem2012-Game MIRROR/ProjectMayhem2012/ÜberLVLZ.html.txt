Rabbit as Symbol: The Significance of Rabbits in Dreams and Art, by Sandy Koi.

"One of the most important archetypes is that of the Psychopomp. A Psychopomp is a god or goddess (energy form) that 
acts as a liaison, and guide, between the three worlds-the physical earthly level that we dwell upon, the Underworld and 
the Heavens. In classical mythology, the Roman God Mercury was a Psychopomp, for example.

HE GUIDED THE ANCIENT HEROES TO AND THROUGH THE UNDERWORLD,
AND HE ALSO BROUGHT MESSAGES FROM ABOVE TO THE MERE MORTALS HERE ON EARTH. 

Symbolically, Rabbit in the Underworld is therefore representative of USING ONE'S INTUITION: knowing how to get around 
"in the dark" and being comfortable traveling in "unmarked territory." By default, it can also denote having or 
DEVELOPING TRUST IN THE "INNER LIGHT."

RABBIT DOES NOT NEED AN OUTSIDE SOURCE TO ILLUMINATE HIS WAY.

His connection to the Collective Energy maintains his pathway.

They teach us Unconditional Love, and Compassion for Life, by virtue of eliciting those things within us.

And one important symbolical meaning that Rabbit should elicit in us is that of PLAYFULNESS AND JOY.
Their nonsense displays of happiness are part of the Dance of Life-which is nothing more than a Cosmic Binkie."
