'The tigers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction.
Great things are done when men and mountains meet.
What is grand is necessarily obscure to weak men. That which can be made explicit to the idiot is not worth my care.
Energy is an eternal delight, and he who desires, but acts not, breeds pestilence.
Do what thou Wilt, this world's a fiction and is made up of contradiction.'
William Blake

Neil Postman's "Amusing Ourselves to Death" is quite the read. Some quotes here including a few videos on the philosophies of a great man.

"Everything in our background has prepared us to know and resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us...
But what if there are no cries of anguish to be heard? Who is prepared to take arms against a sea of amusements?
To whom do we complain, and when, and in what tone of voice, when serious discourse dissolves into giggles?
What is the antidote to a culture's being drained by laughter?" 

"Television is our culture's principal mode of knowing about itself.
Therefore -- and this is the critical point -- how television stages the world becomes the model for how the world is properly to be staged.
It is not merely that on the television screen entertainment is the metaphor for all discourse. It is that off the screen the same metaphor prevails."
"Technology always has unforeseen consequences, and it is not always clear, at the beginning, who or what will win, and who or what will lose..."

In seed time learn, in harvest teach, in winter enjoy.
Drive your cart and your plow over the bones of the dead.
The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.
Prudence is a rich ugly old maid courted by Incapacity.
He who desires but acts not, breeds pestilence.
The cut worm forgives the plow.
Dip him in the river who loves water.
A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees.
He whose face gives no light, shall never become a star.
Eternity is in love with the productions of time.
The busy bee has no time for sorrow.
The hours of folly are measur'd by the clock, but of wisdom: no clock can measure.
All wholsom food is caught without a net or a trap.
Bring out number weight & measure in a year of dearth.
No bird soars too high. if he soars with his own wings.
A dead body, revenges not injuries.
The most sublime act is to set another before you.
If the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise
Folly is the cloke of knavery.
Shame is Prides cloke.
Prisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with bricks of Religion.
The pride of the peacock is the glory of God.
The lust of the goat is the bounty of God.
The wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God.
The nakedness of woman is the work of God.
Excess of sorrow laughs. Excess of joy weeps.
The roaring of lions, the howling of wolves, the raging of the stormy sea, and the destructive sword,
are portions of eternity too great for the eye of man.
The fox condemns the trap, not himself.
Joys impregnate. Sorrows bring forth.
Let man wear the fell of the lion. woman the fleece of the sheep.
The bird a nest, the spider a web, man friendship.
The selfish smiling fool. & the sullen frowning fool, shall be both thought wise. that they may be a rod.
What is now proved was once, only imagind.
The rat, the mouse, the fox, the rabbet;
watch the roots, the lion, the tyger, the horse, the elephant, watch the fruits.
The cistern contains: the fountain overflows
One thought. fills immensity.
Always be ready to speak your mind, and a base man will avoid you.
Every thing possible to be believd is an image of truth.
The eagle never lost so much time. as when he submitted to learn of the crow.

The fox provides for himself, but God provides for the lion.
Think in the morning, Act in the noon, Eat in the evening, Sleep in the night.
He who has suffered you to impose on him knows you.
As the plow follows words, so God rewards prayers.
The tygers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction
Expect poison from the standing water.
You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.
Listen to the fools reproach! it is a kingly title!
The eyes of fire, the nostrils of air, the mouth of water, the beard of earth.
The weak in courage is strong in cunning.
The apple tree never asks the beech how he shall grow, nor the lion, the horse; how he shall take his prey.
The thankful reciever bears a plentiful harvest.
If others had not been foolish, we should be so.
The soul of sweet delight. can never be defil'd,
When thou seest an Eagle, thou seest a portion of Genius. lift up thy head!
As the catterpiller chooses the fairest leaves to layer her eggs on,
so the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys.
To create a little flower is the labour of ages.
Damn, braces: Bless relaxes.
The best wine is the oldest. the best water the newest.
Prayers plow not! Praises reap not!
Joys laugh not! Sorrows weep not!

The head Sublime, the heart Pathos, the genitals Beauty, the hands & feet Proportion.
As the air to a bird or the sea to a fish, so is contempt to the contemptible.
The crow wish'd every thing was black, the owl, that every thing was white.
Exuberance is Beauty.
If the lion was advised by the fox. he would be cunning.
Improvement makes strait roads, but the crooked roads without Improvement, are roads of Genius.
Sooner murder an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desires
Where man is not nature is barren.
Truth can never be told so as to be understood, and not be believ'd.

Enough! or Too much

The ancient Poets animated all sensible objects with Gods or Geniuses,
calling them by the names and adorning them with the properties of woods,
rivers, mountains, lakes, cities, nations, and whatever their enlarged & numerous senses could perceive.
And particularly they studied the genius of each city & country, placing it under its mental deity.
Till a system was formed, which some took advantage of & enslav'd the vulgar by attempting to realize
or abstract the mental deities from their objects; thus began Priesthood.
Choosing forms of worship from poetic tales.
And at length they pronounced that the gods had orderd such things.
Thus men forgot that All deities reside in the human breast.

A teacher at Southwestern University who resonates with Anonymous & V for Vendetta:

Butler Shaffer teaches at the Southwestern University School of Law.
He is the author of 'Calculated Chaos: Institutional Threats to Peace and Human Survival'.

'Perhaps it is reflective of mankind’s capacities for tool-making that, rather than plumbing the depths of our thinking, we have created technologies
that allow us to share the contents of our respective conscious and unconscious minds.
Our computerized technologies are not only the products of our thinking, but the means for expanding its content to EXPONENTIAL LEVELS OF AWARENESS.
They have done more than anything else to dismantle the pyramid and give life to the sphere.
As we are rapidly discovering, there is nothing quite so liberating and life-enhancing as the FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION!'

From 'The New Geometry and the New Math' http://www.lewrockwell.com/shaffer/shaffer229.html

[About V for Vendetta]:

'Prior to my attending V for Vendetta, I encountered reviews by a few statists who saw the film as a “defense of terrorism.”
Such a comment reveals more about the reviewers than of the movie itself.
Any kind of resistance to tyranny is bound to strike terror into the hearts of members of the established order.
Thus were the American colonials and Mohandas Gandhi “terrorists” to the British;
the Warsaw ghetto uprisings and the French underground movements “terrorist” actions to the German government;
and the organized resistance of Algerians acts of “terrorism” to the French.
Even today, the Iraqi resistance to the destruction and domination of their country is regarded as “terrorism” by the invading American state!

The openly anarchistic nature of 'V for Vendetta' will produce shudders in well-conditioned statists who, in the words of F.A. Hayek,
cling to their “fear of trusting uncontrolled social forces.”
Such people will trot out historic instances in which self-proclaimed “anarchists” killed a few score of people, as evidence of the need for government.
That states managed, in the 20th century alone, to slaughter some 200,000,000 people in wars and genocides has never provided an occasion for defenders
of political systems to do a practical cost/benefit analysis of these alternative systems!

There is one poignant scene in this movie in which thousands of unarmed, peaceful individuals confront the well-armed military forces of the state.
This scene, more than any other, may provide insight into how society might evolve in a world in which vertically-structured institutions are collapsing.
The transformations of thinking that are arising from the study of “chaos,” or “complexity,” are producing changes in social behavior that make state systems obsolete.
The predictability the statists imagine inheres in their structured apparatuses has been rendered illusory.
Terry Pratchett's observation that “chaos always defeats order because it is better organized,” reflects a world in flux.
Perhaps a film such a V for Vendetta will provide us an opportunity to begin exploring the orderly nature of anarchistic systems.

I have no doubt that this film will generate “terror” in the minds of those who regard the domination of others either as some inherent right or as an inevitable necessity for social order.
But it is not the fear of violence that will be their principal concern.
Violence will be the fear that the media will transmit to the boobeoisie to keep them huddled at the feet of their masters.
The establishment's fear is not that buildings will be blown up — on the contrary, the destruction of the World Trade Center
actually benefited the state — but that men and women will begin to dismantle the structures of political authority in their thinking.

To paraphrase the words of Evey, it is not buildings that people need, but HOPE.

For those who are serious about living in a society in which peace, liberty, and the inviolability of the human spirit prevail,
V for Vendetta provides an opportunity to rethink our social assumptions; to develop new ideas about our relationships to one another.

And as “V” informs us, “ideas are bulletproof.” This film is A POWERFUL ANTIDOTE TO THE MINDSET THAT IS DESTROYING MANKIND.'

Fellow anons, check out anything by Eben Moglen, specially this video, where he is urging the free speech/hacking comunity to build a robust darknet
in order to make freedom uncensorable:

'The alternate net we need, and how we can build it ourselves - great short talk by Eben Moglen.'
http://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=gORNmfpD0ak&hl=en

[ as seen @ http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/i6342/ ]

"Eben Moglen is a professor of law and legal history at Columbia University, and is the founder,
Director-Counsel and Chairman of Software Freedom Law Center, whose client list includes numerous pro bono clients,
such as the Free Software Foundation.

Moglen's Metaphorical Corollary to Faraday's Law is the idea that the information appearance and flow between
the human minds connected via the Internet works like induction.
Hence Moglen's phrase "Resist the resistance!" (i.e. remove anything that inhibits the flow of information).
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eben_Moglen

Moglen is the leaser of the awesome FreedomBox Foundation. 

FreedomBox: 
Smart devices whose engineered purpose is to work together to facilitate free communication among people,
safely and securely, beyond the ambition of the strongest power to penetrate, they can make freedom of thought
and information a permanent, ineradicable feature of the net that holds our souls.

Faut-il prendre la ’Pataphysique au sérieux?

À un moment ou l’autre de sa vie, même s’il n’en a pas conscience ou s’il ne se les formule pas clairement,
le vrai pataphysicien est confronté dans le plus intime de son être avec les deux propositions suivantes:

Proposition A
Le vrai pataphysicien ne prend rien au sérieux, sauf la ’Pataphysique ... qui consiste à ne rien prendre au sérieux.

Proposition B
La ’Pataphysique consistant à ne rien prendre au sérieux, le vrai pataphysicien ne peut rien prendre au sérieux, même pas la ’Pataphysique.

[...]

Le vrai pataphysicien ne doit pas se prendre soi-même au sérieux.
Elle le met ainsi à l’abri d’une tentation à laquelle cèdent tant, hélas, de ses contemporains !
