'The tigers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction.
Great things are done when men and mountains meet.
What is grand is necessarily obscure to weak men. That which can be made explicit to the idiot is not worth my care.
Energy is an eternal delight, and he who desires, but acts not, breeds pestilence.
Do what thou Wilt, this world's a fiction and is made up of contradiction.'

THE PARADOXES OF THE HIGHEST SCIENCE by Éliphas Lévi[1922]
PARADOX VI.-- ***** THE IMAGINATION REALISES WHAT IT INVENTS *****

"BEHOLD! THE GREATEST MAGICIAN IN THE UNIVERSE! It is she who makes the memory yield its fruit, who realises beforehand 
the Possible, and invents even the Impossible. To her MIRACLES COST NOTHING. She transports houses and mountains through 
the air, places whales in the sky, and stars in the sea, gives paradise to the hashish or opium eaters, offers kingdoms 
to inebriates, and makes Perette dance with joy under the milk pail.

Such is ***** IMAGINATION *****."

"INSPIRATION is the Artist's empirical proof of THE DIVINITY OF THIS IMAGINATION; and all INSPIRATION is divine in origin,
whether used, perverted, hidden or frittered away in reverie.

All IMAGINATIVE and CREATIVE ACTS, being eternal, go to build up a permanent structure, which William Blake calls GOLGONOOZA, 
above time, and, when this structure is finished, nature, its scaffolding, will be knocked away and man will live in it.

***** NOTHING THAT THE HEROES, MARTYRS, PROPHETS AND POETS OF THE PAST HAVE DONE FOR IT HAS BEEN WASTED. *****
***** NO ANONYMOUS AND UNRECOGNISED CONTRIBUTION TO IT HAS BEEN OVERLOOKED. *****

In it is conserved all the good man has done, and in it is completed all that he hoped and intended to do.
And the ARTIST who uses the same energy and genius that Homer and Isaiah had, will find that he not only lives in the
same PALACE OF ART as Homer and Isaiah, but LIVES IN IT at the same time."

Alchemy, Kabbalah & Magick accelerated course:


The mushroom said to me once "Nature Loves Courage". 

Nature LOVES courage. 

And I said "What's the pay off on that?" 

And it said, It shows you that it loves courage because it will remove obstacles. You make the commitment and nature 
will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not 
grind you under, it will lift you up! 

There IS a sort of fair play. You've been told from the cradle that the deck is stacked against you —fall of man, 
original sin, and so forth on and so on... — it's BULLSHIT! 

Its ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT!! 

There IS a sort of fair play, and if you can get in touch with that in your life, you know... 

When Muhammad wouldn't came to the Mountain, the Mountain came to Muhammad: THAT's fair play! 

And, if you can have that perception, 

the WORLD WILL BEGIN TO WORK FOR YOU, it will begin to move towards you...as the Mountain moved towards Muhammad. 

The mushroom said to me once: 

*** NATURE LOVES COURAGE, *** 

Nature *** LOVE *** Courage, 

and I said... what's the payoff of that? 

and it said... 

it shows you that it LOVES COURAGE because IT WILL REMOVE OBSTACLES. 

You MAKE THE COMMITMENT, and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. 

Dream the impossible dream, and the world will not grind you under, it will lift you up. 

THIS IS THE TRICK! 

This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the ALCHEMICAL GOLD, this is 
what they understood, this is the shamanic dance in the waterfall, this is how magic is done: 

it's done by HURLING YOURSELF INTO THE ABYSS, and discovering that it's a feather bed. 

There's NO other way to DO IT."

Joseph Beuys (1921-05-12 – 1986-01-23) was a German Conceptual artist who produced work in a number of forms including 
sculpture, performance art, video art and installations. He was inspired by the ideas of Rudolph Steiner and the 
French artist Yves Klein.

Beuys enlarged the area of art to the whole life of mankind; EVERYBODY IS AN ARTIST. He intrduced the notion of social sculpture.

Social sculpture is a specific example of the extended concept of art, that was advocated by the conceptual artist and 
politician Joseph Beuys. Beuys created the term Social Sculpture to illustrate his idea of ART'S POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM 
SOCIETY. As an artwork it includes human activity, that strives to structure and shape society or the environment. THE 
CENTRAL IDEA OF A SOCIAL SCULPTOR IS AN ARTIST, WHO CREATES STRUCTURES IN SOCIETY USING LANGUAGE, THOUGHT, ACTION, AND 
OBJECT. 

"Let's talk of A SYSTEM THAT TRANSFORMS ALL THE SOCIAL ORGANISMS INTO A WORK OF ART, in which the entire process of work is included...
something in which the principle of production and consumption takes on a form of quality. It's a Gigantic project."

“Only on condition of a radical widening of definitions will it be possible for art and activities related to art [to] 
provide evidence that art is now the only evolutionary-revolutionary power. Only art is capable of dismantling the 
repressive effects of a senile social system that continues to totter along the deathline: to dismantle in order to 
build ‘A SOCIAL ORGANISM AS A WORK OF ART’… EVERY HUMAN BEING IS AN ARTIST who – from his state of freedom – 
the position of freedom that he experiences at first-hand – learns to determine the other positions of the TOTAL ART 
WORK OF THE FUTURE SOCIAL ORDER.”

The individual

BEUYS BELIEVED EVERYBODY WAS AN ARTIST, he once said “every sphere of human activity, Even peeling a potato can be a 
work of art as long as it is ***** A CONSCIOUS ACT *****.” The idea being that EVERY DECISION YOU MAKE should be thought out and 
attempt to make or CONTRIBUTE TO A WORK OF ART WHICH IN THE END IS SOCIETY. This point of view 
invites followers to humble themselves by realizing that THEY ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF A WHOLE, NOT ONLY AN INDIVIDUAL. 

"I MYSELF DETERMINE HISTORY – it is not history that determines me... EVERY MAN IS A POTENTIAL PROVOCATEUR."

ART ALONE MAKES LIFE POSSIBLE – this is how radically I should like to formulate it. I would say that WITHOUT ART MAN 
IS INCONCEIVABLE IN PHYSIOLOGICAL TERMS.. ..I would say man does not consist only of chemical processes, but also of 
metaphysical occurrences. The provocateur of the chemical processes is located outside the world. MAN IS ONLY TRULY 
ALIVE WHEN HE REALIZES HE IS A CREATIVE, ARTISTIC BEING. 

"I am not a teacher who tells his students only to think. I say: ***** ACT *****; ***** DO SOMETHING *****: I ask for result.
It may take different forms. It can have the form of sound, or someone can do a book, make a drawing or a sculpture. I don’t 
care..." 

"EVERY HUMAN BEING IS AN ARTIST who – from his state of freedom – the position of freedom that he experience at firsthand –
learns to determine the other positions in the TOTAL ARTWORK OF THE FUTURE SOCIAL ORDER."

"After I am dead I would like people to say:
'BEUYS UNDERSTOOD THE HISTORICAL SITUATION. HE ALTERED THE COURSE OF EVENTS'.
I hope in the right direction."

Account of the SARMOUN BROTHERHOOD
Desmond R. Martin, 1965:

"There are many legends about Sarmoun-Dargauh ('COURT OF THE BEES'), and one of them is this. True knowledge, it is 
asserted, exists as a positive commodity, like the HONEY OF THE BEE. Like HONEY, it can be accumulated. From time to 
time in human history, however, it lies unused and starts to leak away. On those occasions the Sarmouni and their 
associates all over the world collect it and store it in a special receptacle.

Then, WHEN THE TIME IS RIPE, THEY RELEASE IT INTO THE WORLD AGAIN, through specially trained emissaries."

DARE to CREATE your Dream Reality is going to Bee our magickal motto.

1. Grab a pen or a pencil, -unless you got a drawing tablet, it's better than using the mouse, but feel free to use the mouse if you prefer-,
and draw a picture of what it is for you that you would like to SEE happening worldwide next December 21 2012, 11:11.
Relax and allow your imagination to just fly: you can draw ANYTHING you feel like, you are not going to be judged for it.
Don't try to do something 'beautiful' just so that other anons admire your work: 
open your mind to whatever the Universe tells you and be HONEST about what you'd like to see happening.

It doesn't matter that you 'don't know' how to draw: remember when we were inhibited children, ALL OF US know how to draw, right!?

Only two rules in this game:

* You have to use these 4 colours only: BLACK, WHITE, YELLOW, RED.
* You have to include a BEE in your drawing.

2. When you are finished, scan it and upload it to your personal blog, to any image hosting site such as imgur.com or send it as an attachment by email.

3. To Find The Others, SHARE your Creation with the Bees in the Hive Mind, as other anons already did. See below.

Send your artwork to |=-------------------=[   anon ['@'] projectmayhem2012.org    ]=-------------------=|

If selected, we will be publishing your Magick Reality Hacking drawings in the next HiveMinds[].html
You can also post them to http://www.whatis-theplan.org/t1676-project-mayhem-2012 and anywhere you want as well.

Further clues will be unlocked when a minimum 10 anons publish their artwork.

On those occasions the Sarmouni and their associates all over the world collect it and store it in a special receptacle.'

'Then, WHEN THE TIME IS RIPE, THEY RELEASE IT INTO THE WORLD AGAIN, through specially trained emissaries.'

***** THE ENIGMA OF THE SPHYNX *****

The Four Powers of the Magus: Noscere, Audere, Velle, Tacere.


 The Four Powers of the Sphinx--TO KNOW, TO WILL, TO DARE AND TO KEEP SILENT --are an important element of Thelemic 
symbolism and instruction. The origin of the Four Powers of the Sphinx is unclear. Practically nothing is written on the 
subject outside of the works of Aleister Crowley. The only other author to mention the subject with any degree of depth 
or seriousness is the French occultist Eliphas Lévi 

That Lévi had a profound influence on Crowley there is no doubt. Crowley translated Lévi’s The Key of the Mysteries 
as his own Adeptus Minor thesis, and Crowley went as far to claim in Magick in Theory and Practice that he was the 
reincarnation of Lévi! Therefore, it is not unreasonable to suggest that Lévi influenced Crowley in the matter of the 
Four Powers of the Sphinx. By surveying the work of Eliphas Lévi, so shall we come to a better understanding of the 
Four Powers of the Sphinx. 

Our first introduction to the Four Powers of the Sphinx comes from Lévi’s most popular work, Transcendental Magic: 

“To attain the SANCTUM REGNUM, in other words, the knowledge and power of the Magi, there are FOUR INDISPENSABLE 
CONDITIONS:

* an INTELLIGENCE illuminated by study,
* an INTREPIDITY which nothing can check,
* a WILL which cannot be broken, and
* a PRUDENCE which nothing can corrupt and nothing intoxicate. 

TO KNOW, TO DARE, TO WILL, TO KEEP SILENCE --such are the four words of the Magus, inscribed upon the four symbolical
forms of the sphinx.” 

Levi here offers the Four Powers as the words of the Magus and casually links them with the Sphinx. He goes on in the 
same chapter to link the Four Powers of the Sphinx with the four Elements and the four Kerubic Signs of the zodiac: 

“You are called to be king of AIR, WATER, EARTH and FIRE; but to reign over these four living creatures of symbolism, 
it is necessary to conquer and enchain them. He who aspires to be a sage and to know THE GREAT ENIGMA OF NATURE must be 
the heir and despoiler of the sphinx: his the human head, in order to possess speech; his the eagle’s wings, in order 
to scale the heights; his the bull’s flanks, in order to furrow the depths; his the lion’s talons, to make a way on 
the right and the left, before and behind.” 

The Sphinx is a composite creature, having the head of a Man, the torso and front paws of a Lion, the backside of a Bull 
and the wings of the Eagle. It symbolizes the synthesis and synergy of the Four Powers, represented by the “fourliving 
creatures of symbolism” (the Kerubs) who have been “conquered and enchained” into one figure, the Sphinx. (See 
Table 1 for correspondences.) The aspirant is instructed to be the “heir and despoiler of the sphinx,” to both 
receive and to partake of the four Elements. 

The nature of the Sphinx is further explained in The Magical Ritual of the Sanctum Regnum: 

“You must thoroughly understand that elemental beings are souls of an imperfect type, not yet raised in the scale up 
to human existence, and that they can only manifest power when called into action by the adept as auxiliaries to his 
will, by means of that universal astral fluid in which they live. The kingdom of the Gnomes is assigned to the North, 
the Salamanders to the South, the Sylphs to the East, and the Undines to the West.... 

“Their symbols are those of Taurus the Bull for Gnomes; Leo the Lion for Salamanders; the Eagle for Sylphs; and the 
sign of Aquarius for Undines.... 

“The combination of these four types of face and being represents the Created Universe, a complete and eternal entity, 
Man in fact, the Microcosm; and this is the first formula of the mystical explanation of the enigma of the Sphynx.” 

The implication is that MAN IS THE SPHINX, as both are composed of the four Elements. Lévi clarifies this idea later in 
the text: 

“Do you now understand THE ENIGMA OF THE SPHYNX? 

...Yes, you know that THE SPHYNX REFERS TO MAN. 

But do you know that the Sphynx is one and alone, and remains unchanged, while as to man--is not each one a Sphynx of a 
different synthesis?” 

Man is like the Sphinx. Both are composed of the four Elements, but in Man they exists in different proportions and are 
unbalanced, while in the Sphinx the Elements are balanced and synergistic.

THE SPHINX REPRESENTS THE PERFECTED MAN, ***** the Magus. *****

The Four Powers of the Sphinx are “THE FOUR WORDS OF THE MAGUS,” the “four indispensable conditions” 
which bring Man to the state of perfection and balance symbolized by the Sphinx. 

Lévi instructs us HOW TO PRACTICALLY APPLY the Four Powers of the Sphinx in his final work, THE GREAT SECRET: 

“The great secret of magic, the unique and incommunicable Arcana, has for its purpose the placing of supernatural 
power at the service of the human will in some way. 

To attain such an achievement it is necessary

* to KNOW what has to be done,
* to WILL what is required,
* to DARE what must be attempted and
* to KEEP SILENT with discernment. 

Levi goes on to give us a mythical example: 

“Homer’s Odysseus had to contend with the gods, the elements, the cyclops, the sirens, Circe, etc. ... that is to 
say with all the difficulties and dangers of life. 

His palace is invaded, his wife is pestered, his goods are plundered, his death is resolved on, he loses his comrades, 
his ships are sunk; at last, he alone is left to fight it out against the night and the sea. And single-handed he sways 
the gods, he escapes from the sea, he blinds the cyclops, he cheats the sirens, he masters Circe, he re-takes his 
palace, he rescues his wife, he slays those plotting his death;

because he WILLED to see Ithaca and Penelope again, 
because he always KNEW how to extricate himself from danger,
because he DARED what had to be done and
because he always KEPT SILENT when it was not expedient to speak.” 

Finally, Levi indicates where to start in our endeavor to become the Sphinx: 

“When one does not KNOW, one should WILL to learn.

To the extent that one does not know it is foolhardy to dare, but it is always well to keep silent.” 

Thus the Four Powers are employed much like steps in a process; we must know before we can will, and so on. This idea is 
reinforced in Transcendental Magick: 

“To learn how to will is to learn how to exercise dominion. But to be able to exert will power you must first know; 
for will power applied to folly is madness, death, and hell.” 

Also: 

“In order to DARE we must KNOW; in order to WILL, we must DARE; we must WILL to possess empire and to reign we must BE 
SILENT.” 

So ends our survey of the Four Powers of the Sphinx as defined and developed by Eliphas Levi. In our next essay, we will 
examine Crowley’s writings on the Powers of the Sphinx, including the addition of a Fifth Power--to Go.

PM2012 Commentary to 'the Enigma of the Sphinx' text above.

First, a very good clarification on the 4 Powers of the Magus linked to Self-Knowledge:

"The only thing I find that I like more than learning something new is learning about learning. META-LEARNING perhaps? 

Recently, I was fortunate enough to learn about a cognitive psychological tool known as the "Johari Window" I was at a 
seminar where the speaker suggested that human beings come to awareness of any given thing in four general stages. This 
window can be disected into a graph whereupon we have unconscious and conscious right and left of an imaginary y-axis; 
and incompetent and competent above and below an imaginary x-axis. If you're imagining this properly it should appear as 
a Mendelian Square.

In stage one, a person is unconsciously incompetent, they aren't even aware that they are unaware. If you've read 
Ouspensky or Gurdjieff then you're probably pretty familiar with this idea: ever referring to man as asleep and 
incapable of recognizing it due to an obstinate belief that one is awake. 

Next, is conscious incompetent. Here our example is frustrated, realizing that s/he is unaware yet not possessing the 
skills with which to become aware. In the unconscious competent stage our subject knows about their awareness but isn't 
sure how they've accomplished this. In the final stage they cannot only reach deeper states of awareness, but if they so 
choose, TEACH OTHERS." 

Check the square at: http://rosicrucian-vault.blogspot.com/2010/02/eliphas-levi-and-johari-window.html

Pulling it together: one must be foolhardy (unconsious incompetent) and Dare to go against the grain of their culture, 
their mentality, and all their former learning and realize they have a to deep yearning to be or do something greater 
than previously thought possible. (For those interested in fostering healthy memes, the book Boomeritus, by Ken Wilbur 
is an excellent example of how to take conscious control of focusing on positive mind viruses) 

Will to learn about that yearning (in whatever form it manifests). 

At this point, one knows what they know, but more importantly they realize that they know very little and so in an 
attempt to foster more awareness, to be awareness as it were they are silent. This is the point at which a person stops 
studying magic and begins to experiment with the world as a magician."

Secondly,

"To the extent that one does not know it is foolhardy to dare, but it is always well to keep silent.” 
Full text: Eliphas Levi - The Great Secret. http://sacred-sex.org/western/levi-the-great-secret

That's the LAST phrase of the text. This means that it carries a strong semantical value associated with it.

The Magus has to learn WHEN to DISOBEY.

'Initiates' have been coding their teachings so that only those who DARED to question them, that is,
only those who DARED to 'kill the buddha whenever they found one', that is, only those who DARED to follow
their own heart, their own INTUITION, their own INSTINCT to detect Beauty & Truth and avoid bullshit where deem worthy
to decode their teachings.

The Greatest Teaching any Teacher can teach is to teach the pupil to kill the Teacher and to give her the TOOLS
required to start to BE YOUR OWN TEACHER.


So called 'Demons' ( = our FEARS, DOUBTS AND DISBELIEFS about what we KNOW that we HAVE to DO), don't reach the one who is
absolutely centered in their WILL: the ZENtral Point within the Circumference.

Neo DARES to JUMP THE ABYSS.

"In the Qabalistic system of Crowley, the Abyss contains the 11th (hidden) sephira, Da'ath, which separates the lower 
sephiroth from the supernals. This account derives from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn's view of Genesis,[7] in 
which Da'ath represents the fall of man from a unified consciousness into a duality between ego and divine nature.[8] 
The Abyss is guarded by the demon Choronzon, who manifests during the third, ceremonial method of crossing this gulf. He 
represents those parts of one's consciousness and unconsciousness -- "a momentary unity capable of sensation and of 
expression," in Crowley's terms[9] -- that are unwilling or unable to enter the Divine.

According to *** GRANT MORRISON *** in the Richard Metzger Book of Lies, at least, Choronzon 

"is Existential Self at the last gasp...Beyond Choronzon we are no longer our Self. The "personality" on the brink of the 
Abyss will do anything, say anything and find any excuse to avoid taking this disintegrating step into "non-being."[10]"

"Crossing the Abyss" is regarded as a perilous operation, and THE MOST IMPORTANT WORK OF THE MAGICIAN'S CAREER.

Success confers graduation into the degree of Magister Templi, or "Master of the Temple."
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abyss_(Thelema)#Theory_and_Practice

Yet, nobody succeeds in their first attempt: yet, NOTHING happens, as Terence McKenna shows us, Nature LOVES COURAGE:
the Abyss of Daath is A FEATHER BED.

In other words:

Time is ripe to DARE even when you don't KNOW.
Time is ripe to SHARE and NOT to remain silent any more.

Morpheus: You gotta let it all go Neo. FEAR, DOUBT and DISBELIEF.

Rabbit as Symbol: The Significance of Rabbits in Dreams and Art, by Sandy Koi.

"One of the most important archetypes is that of the Psychopomp. A Psychopomp is a god or goddess (energy form) that 
acts as a liaison, and guide, between the three worlds-the physical earthly level that we dwell upon, the Underworld and 
the Heavens. In classical mythology, the Roman God Mercury was a Psychopomp, for example.

HE GUIDED THE ANCIENT HEROES TO AND THROUGH THE UNDERWORLD,
AND HE ALSO BROUGHT MESSAGES FROM ABOVE TO THE MERE MORTALS HERE ON EARTH. 

Symbolically, Rabbit in the Underworld is therefore representative of USING ONE'S INTUITION: knowing how to get around 
"in the dark" and being comfortable traveling in "unmarked territory." By default, it can also denote having or 
DEVELOPING TRUST IN THE "INNER LIGHT."

RABBIT DOES NOT NEED AN OUTSIDE SOURCE TO ILLUMINATE HIS WAY.

His connection to the Collective Energy maintains his pathway.

They teach us Unconditional Love, and Compassion for Life, by virtue of eliciting those things within us.

And one important symbolical meaning that Rabbit should elicit in us is that of PLAYFULNESS AND JOY.
Their nonsense displays of happiness are part of the Dance of Life-which is nothing more than a Cosmic Binkie."
