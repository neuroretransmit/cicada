Account of the SARMOUN BROTHERHOOD
Desmond R. Martin, 1965:

"There are many legends about Sarmoun-Dargauh ('COURT OF THE BEES'), and one of them is this. True knowledge, it is 
asserted, exists as a positive commodity, like the HONEY OF THE BEE. Like HONEY, it can be accumulated. From time to 
time in human history, however, it lies unused and starts to leak away. On those occasions the Sarmouni and their 
associates all over the world collect it and store it in a special receptacle.

Then, WHEN THE TIME IS RIPE, THEY RELEASE IT INTO THE WORLD AGAIN, through specially trained emissaries."

"The CONSCIOUSNESS of a BEEHIVE, not the individual Bees, is of a very high nature.
Humankind will not obtain the Wisdom of such CONSCIOUSNESS until the next major revolutionary stage
 —that of Venus— which will come when the evolution of the earth stage has finished.
 
Then human beings will possess the CONSCIOUSNESS necessary to construct things with A MATERIAL THEY CREATE WITHIN THEMSELVES."

Dear Anons,

"The Secret protects itself by virtue of its implausibility." 
Idries Shah paraphrased from the sufi tradition.

We are entering a new era: the End of all Secrets.
No more 'occult' secrets anymore neither.
Whenever magick is needed to help Human kind to evolve, the veils disappear.

You are a BEE. We are the BEES. We are going to show how to produce some Golden Honey.

Empower yourself: Empower the Hive Mind.

Todays crash-course lesson on R-EVOLUTION:

Alchemy.

Alchemy is about CONSCIOUSNESS. And, yes, there's a scientifical basis behind this. Keep on reading if you'd like to find out how.

First of all, forget about trying to 'understand' Alchemy just by reading books: there are +80 different names for the Philosopher Stone alone.

(see http://www.levity.com/alchemy/gratacol.html for a brief account of them, by 1652.)

Don't worry bee. Time is ripe. You don't need to work hard to find out. We are only going to feed you with the best Royal Jelly of Knowledge.

Alchemy is a LABYRINTH, designed to confuse you.

This is done so that the alchemist GIVES UP his 'rational', 'logical' or left brain and so that his mind starts to resonate with his right brain.

(See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralization_of_brain_function )

Alchemists used the 'Language of the Birds' or 'Green Language', Phonetic Cabala, Temurah,
Gematria, Notarikon... to code 'secret' information within their texts.

See:

In Kabbalah, Rennaissance magic, and alchemy, the language of the birds was considered a secret and perfect language and 
the key to perfect knowledge, sometimes also called the langue verte, or green language (Jean Julien Fulcanelli, 
Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa de occulta philosophia). 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_of_the_birds#Alchemy

The Phonetic Cabala

According to Fulcanelli, the Phonetic Cabala is not the Hebrew Kabbalah; even the derivation is different: Cabala is 
derived from the Latin caballus, a horse, as in the Horse of Troy in the Iliad. It is basically homophonic and symphonic 
rather than numerical; it is based on phonetic assonance and resonance to echo the Gay Science in the words of the 
Hellenic gods spoken in sacred Ancient Greek nomenclature. According to Walter Lang, who wrote an introduction to the 
English translation of Fulcanelli's Le Mystère des Cathédrales, the basic principles of the Phonetic Cabala are 
restored in Fulcanelli's Magnum Opus. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Julien_Fulcanelli#The_Phonetic_Cabala

See also:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temurah_(Kabbalah)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gematria
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notarikon

"Almost every commentator on Fulcanelli's work agrees that the 
explanation of the "Green Language" given in chapter 3 of part one of 
MotC is the heart of the book. It is the concept that you must grasp in 
order to have any chance at understanding (the sephiroth attributed to 
its location in the Tree of Life is Binah, or Understanding) the rest of 
the book."
http://www.sangraal.com/AMET/prologue.html

There are at least two powerful explanations behind this:

First, the 'secrets' would be hidden from those who were not deem 'worthy' to Know.

Secondly, the 'secrets' would only be accessible to those HUMBLE enough to GIVE UP their rational mind.
These would be the only ones ready to PLAY with their minds: that is, to start to PLAY with ther ACTIVE IMAGINATION.

See:

"Active Imagination is a concept developed by Carl Jung between 1913 and 1916. It is a meditation technique wherein the 
contents of one's unconscious are translated into images, narrative or personified as separate entities. It can serve as 
a bridge between the conscious 'ego' and the unconscious and includes working with dreams and the creative self via 
imagination or fantasy. Jung linked Active Imagination with the processes of alchemy in that both strive for oneness and 
inter-relatedness from a set of fragmented and dissociated parts. 

KEY TO THE PROCESS OF ACTIVE IMAGINATION IS THE GOAL OF EXERTING AS LITTLE INFLUENCE AS POSSIBLE ON MENTAL IMAGES AS 
THEY UNFOLD. For example, if a person were recording a spoken visualization of a scene or object from a dream, Jung's 
approach would ask the practitioner to observe the scene, watch for changes, and report them, rather than to consciously 
fill the scene with one's desired changes. One would then respond genuinely to these changes, and report any further 
changes in the scene. This approach is meant to ensure that the unconscious contents express themselves without 
OVERBEARING INFLUENCE FROM THE CONSCIOUS MIND. AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, JUNG WAS INSISTENT THAT SOME FORM OF 
particiPATION IN ACTIVE IMAGINATION WAS ESSENTIAL: 'YOU YOURSELF MUST ENTER INTO THE PROCESS WITH YOUR PERSONAL 
REACTIONS...AS IF THE DRAMA BEING ENACTED BEFORE YOUR EYES WERE REAL'.[1] 

Of the origination of active imagination, Jung wrote: 

“It was during Advent of the year 1913 – December 12, to be exact – that I resolved upon the decisive step. I was 
sitting at my desk once more, thinking over my fears. Then I let myself drop. Suddenly it was as though the ground 
literally gave way beneath my feet, and I plunged into the dark depths.” [2] 

Carl Jung developed this technique as one of several that would define his distinctive contribution to the practice of 
psychotherapy. Active imagination is a method for visualizing unconscious issues by letting them act themselves out. 
Active imagination can be done by visualization (which is how Jung himself did it), which can be considered similar in 
technique at least to shamanic journeying. Active imagination can also be done by automatic writing, or by artistic 
activities such as dance, music, painting, sculpting, ceramics, crafts, etc. Jung considered indeed that 'The patient 
can make himself creatively independent through this method...by painting himself he gives shape to himself'.[3] Doing 
active imagination permits the thoughtforms of the unconscious, or inner 'self', and of the totality of the psyche, to 
act out whatever messages they are trying to communicate to the conscious mind. 

For Jung however, this technique had the potential not only to allow communication between the conscious and unconscious 
aspects of the personal psyche with its varIOUS COMPONENTS AND INTER-DYNAMICS, BUT ALSO BETWEEN THE PERSONAL AND 
'COLLECTIVE' UNCONSCIOUS; and therefore was to be embarked upon with due care and attentiveness. Indeed, he warned with 
respect to '"active imagination"...THE METHOD IS NOT ENTIRELY WITHOUT DANGER, BECAUSE IT MAY CARRY THE PATIENT TOO FAR 
AWAY FROM REALITY'. The post-Jungian Michael Fordham was to go further, suggesting that 'active imagination, as a 
transitional phenomenon ...can be, and often is, both in adults and children put to nefarious purposes and promotes 
psychopathology'."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_imagination

See 'Creative Imagination - The Brain's Most Powerful Ability':
http://www.helpyourchildsucceed.com/creativeimagination.htm

It's only when the alchemist is in deep despair after spending many years trying to advance that he humbly begs 'god' for help.

Then he starts to 'hallucinate'. Or, in other words, he starts to decode the alchemical texts in a different light:

he starts to allow himself to PLAY with 'Reality',
he starts to allow himself to PLAY with with symbols,
he starts to allow himself to PLAY with with images.

He starts to allow 'Life' to speak to him.

This is exactly the same reason behind the extremely powerful 'Oath of the Abyss' by british magician, occultist and Artist, Aleister Crowley:

Oath of the Abyss

I, O.M., etc., a member of the Body of God, hereby bind myself on behalf of the Whole Universe, even as we are now physically bound unto the cross of suffering:
II. that I will lead a pure life, as a devoted servant of the Order:
III. that I will understand all things:
IV. that I will love all things:
V. that I will perform all things and endure all things:
VI. that I will continue in the Knowledge and Conversation of my Holy Guardian Angel:
VII. that I will work without attachment:
VIII. that I will work in truth:
IX. that I will rely only upon myself:
X. that I will interpret every phenomenon as a particular dealing of God with my Soul.

And if I fail herein, may my pyramid be profaned, and the Eye closed to me.

(See http://www.tomegatherion.co.uk/thelema.htm )

The extremely challenging part here is 'X. that I will interpret every phenomenon as a particular dealing of God with my Soul.'
Obviously, when done obsessively, this oath will trigger a 'psychotic trance' in any sane person, designed to break his 'rational' mind and to
open the gates of 'magick', which is another word for ACTIVE IMAGINATION.

ACTIVE IMAGINATION IS SAID TO GUIDE, ANTICIPATE AND MOULD SENSE PERCEPTION, AND
TO TRANSMUTE SENSORY DATA INTO SYMBOLS. A distinction is made between imagination
and fantasy. The former, IMAGINATIO, IS THE MAGICAL PRODUCTION OF AN IMAGE, WHICH
PRODUCES THE SPIRIT IN FORMS AND COLOURS, AND IS ‘THE FULFILMENT OF BEING IN AN IMAGE
AND A TRANSPOSITION OF THE IMAGE INTO BEING’ (CORBIN 1969: 282). WHILE FANTASY IS
CONSIDERED TO BE THE ‘MADMAN’S CORNERSTONE’ (P. 179), IMAGINATION IS LINKED TO ‘ALAM
AL-MITHAL, ‘THE WORLD OF IDEA-IMAGES, THE WORLD OF APPARITIONAL FORMS AND OF BODIES
IN THE SUBTILE STATE’ (P. 217). IMAGINATION IS THE INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN THE WORLD OF
PURE SPIRITUAL REALITIES, THE WORLD OF MYSTERY AND THE VISIBLE, SENSIBLE WORLD. THE
IMAGINATION HAS METAPHYSICAL STATUS.

Ibn ‘Arabi distinguishes between imagination that is conjoined to the imagining
subject (it is inseparable from the person), and a self-subsisting imagination
dissociable from the subject. Imaginations that are conjoined to the imagining subject
are provoked by a conscious process of the mind, while those that are dissociable
from the subject present themselves to the mind spontaneously like dreams (or
daydreams). The specific character of the conjoined imagination is its inseparability
from the imagining subject, with whom it lives and dies.

The imagination separable from the subject, on the other hand, has an autonomous
and subsisting reality sui generis on the plane of the intermediary world, the world
of idea-images. Exterior to the imagining subject, it can be seen by others, such
as mystics or psychics. The separable images subsist in a world specific to them,
so that the imagination in which they occur ‘has the status of an “essence” (hadrat
dhatiya) perpetually capable of receiving ideas and Spirits and of giving them the
“apparitional body” that makes possible their epiphany . . .’ (Corbin 1969: 219). All
this demonstrates the extraordinary role of the image in the spirituality of Ibn ‘Arabi,
and the importance of developing the imagination.

IF ONE IMAGINES, SAY, A POOL OF WATER, THEN THE POOL OF WATER IS A ‘NEW CREATION’,
AND PRECISELY BECAUSE IT IS ‘IMAGINED’, THE IMAGE, ONCE RECOGNIZED AS SUCH, BECOMES
REAL AND MEANINGFUL RATHER THAN ILLUSORY. Finke’s theory of ‘levels of equivalence’,
mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, can be partially employed here, in that
what the Sufi sees through himma is perceived to be just as real as an object that is
perceived through everyday sight. However, the Sufis are taking this a step further,
as the distinction is made between imagination that is conjoined and imagination
that is dissociable. In the latter case, the image has a life apart from the subject,
existing separately.

THE PURPOSE OF ENHANCING THE FUNCTION OF HIMMA, OR THE IMAGINATIVE FACULTY, IS
TO PERCEIVE THE ‘INTERMEDIATE WORLD’ IN ORDER TO RAISE SENSORY DATA TO A HIGHER LEVEL,
so as to permit Sufis to ‘fulfil their theophanic function’ and thereby gain greater
understanding of knowledge of the Divine (Corbin 1969: 239).

". . . O resolute seeker! Enter with me into the Ka’aba of the Hijr, for that is the Temple
that rises above all veils and coverings. It is the entrance of the Gnostics; there is the
repose of the pilgrims engaged in the processional."

(See: http://www.scribd.com/doc/55598196/14/Islam-and-the-Su%EF%AC%81s )

Don't worry, we are not going to recommend you that you follow this path.
You don't need to neither: the gates are fully open for everybody, no risks involved in
obtaining the Philosopher Stone anymore!

Synchronicities are a very powerful way of contacting the 'COLLECTIVE' UNCONSCIOUS. Nobel laureate
Wolfgang Pauli also sensed that there was something extremely intriguing about this and worked
with Jung to find out what this was, from a strictly scientifical point of view.

"Jung coined the word to describe what he called "temporally coincident occurrences of acausal events." Jung variously 
described synchronicity as an "acausal connecting principle", "meaningful coincidence" and "acausal parallelism". Jung 
introduced the concept as early as the 1920s but only gave a full statement of it in 1951 in an Eranos lecture[3] and in 
1952, published a paper, Synchronizität als ein Prinzip akausaler Zusammenhänge (Synchronicity — An Acausal 
Connecting Principle)[4], in a volume with a related study by the physicist (and Nobel laureate) Wolfgang Pauli.

Even at Jung's presentation of his work on synchronicity in 1951 at an Eranos lecture his ideas on synchronicity were 
still evolving. Following discussions with both Albert Einstein and Wolfgang Pauli JUNG BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE 
PARALLELS BETWEEN SYNCHRONICITY AND ASPECTS OF RELATIVITY THEORY AND QUANTUM MECHANICS. Jung was transfixed by the idea 
that life was not a series of random events but rather an expression of a deeper order, which he and Pauli referred to 
as Unus mundus. 

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity

For our purposes (helping YOU to Evolve) all you need to know is that Alchemy is about the number 3, as can bee seen 
in this alchemical painting:

http://i.imgur.com/asedl.jpg

Alchemy is also about something very close to you: COMPUTING.

It's about the Sulphur, the Salt and the Mercury. That is, the 0, the 1 and the MIRROR.

This is profoundly related to the Golden Ratio. Yes.

If you decide to keep on playing to beecome a Magician, we will explain this to you in further levels of this Game.

For now, also know that, vibrationally speaking, this is The Most powerful colour combination ever:

BLACK
WHITE
YELLOW
RED

Yellowish can or cannot be present, yet the combination of Black, White and Red retains its full power.

Know that whenever you are using this colour combination in your Art, you are resonating with the Alchemical Work
and attracting the best of possible results.

The Great Work (Latin: Magnum opus) is an alchemical term for the process of creating the philosopher's stone.
It has been used to describe personal and spiritual transmutation in the Hermetic tradition,
attached to laboratory processes and chemical color changes, used as a model for the individuation process,
and as a device in art and literature.
The magnum opus has been carried forward in new age and neo-hermetic movements which sometimes attached new symbolism
and significance to the processes.

It originally had four stages:

NIGREDO, a blackening or melanosis
ALBEDO, a whitening or leucosis
CITRINITAS, a yellowing or xanthosis
RUBEDO, a reddening, purpling, or iosis

"To IMAGINE is everything, to know is nothing at all." 
                                          Anatole France 1881
										  
"I believe that MAGICK is Art, and that Art, whether that be music, writing, sculpture, or any other form, is literally MAGICK.
Art is, like magic, the science of manipulating symbols, words or images, to achieve changes in consciousness…
Indeed to cast a spell is simply to spell, to manipulate words, TO CHANGE PEOPLE'S CONSCIOUSNESS, and this is why
I believe that an artist or writer is the closest thing in the contemporary world to a shaman."

"Henry Stapp is an American physicist. Under the supervision of Nobel Laureates Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain, 
Stapp moved to ETH Zurich to do post-doctoral work under Wolfgang Pauli. During this period he composed an article 
called 'MIND, MATTER AND QUANTUM MECHANICS', which he never sent for publication, but would become the title of his 1993 
book. When Pauli died in 1958, Stapp transferred to Munich, now in the company of Werner Heisenberg. While making 
important contributions to, inter alia, the analysis of proton-proton scattering and the development of analytic 
S-matrix theory, Stapp is perhaps most well known for his ongoing work in the foundations of quantum mechanics, with 
particular focus on explicating the role and nature of consciousness. He is also an expert on Bell's Theorem, having 
solved problems related to non-locality presented by John Bell and Albert Einstein. He currently performs his research 
at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 

Stapp is one of those who favours the idea that QUANTUM WAVES COLLAPSE ONLY WHEN THEY INTERACT WITH CONSCIOUSNESS. He 
argues that QUANTUM WAVES COLLAPSE WHEN INTELLIGENT BRAINS SELECT ONE AMONG THE ALTERNATIVE QUANTUM POSSIBILITIES AS A 
BASIS FOR FUTURE ACTION. Stapp postulates more global collapse via his 'mind like' wave-function collapse that exploits 
certain aspects of the quantum Zeno effect within the synapses to explain attention. His views are spelled out most 
clearly in his book, MINDFUL UNIVERSE: QUANTUM MECHANICS AND THE PARTICIPATING OBSERVER according to at least one 
orthodox contemporary theory, THE UNIVERSE OF WHICH WE ARE PART EVOLVES, INSOFAR AS CONTEMPORARY SCIENCE CAN SAY, IN A 
WAY THAT NEED NOT BE DETERMINED EXCLUSIVELY BY THE MATTER-LIKE ASPECTS OF NATURE (although the existence of immaterial 
determining factors remains speculative). A corollary of this view of reality is that the history of the universe need 
not be a fixed 4 dimensional structure, as nineteenth century physics proclaimed, but is CONSTANTLY FORGING AHEAD INTO 
THE FUTURE, in keeping with common sense. ACCORDING TO STAPP, EACH INCREASE IN HUMAN KNOWLEDGE IS ASSOCIATED WITH A WAVE 
FUNCTION COLLAPSE, WHICH IS AN '***** ACT OF CREATION *****' THAT IS A STEP ALONG THE ARROW OF TIME. THUS, FREE WILL COULD BE SEEN 
AS DIRECTLY INSTRUMENTAL IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE UNIVERSE."

"INSPIRATION is the Artist's empirical proof of THE DIVINITY OF THIS IMAGINATION; and all INSPIRATION is divine in origin,
whether used, perverted, hidden or frittered away in reverie.
All imaginative and creative acts, being eternal, go to build up a permanent structure, which William Blake calls GOLGONOOZA, 
above time, and, when this structure is finished, nature, its scaffolding, will be knocked away and man will live in it. 
Nothing that the heroes, martyrs, prophets and poets of the past have done for it has been wasted;
NO ANONYMOUS AND UNRECOGNISED CONTRIBUTION TO IT HAS BEEN OVERLOOKED. In it is conserved all the good man has done, and in 
it is completed all that he hoped and intended to do. And the ARTIST who uses the same energy and genius that Homer and 
Isaiah had will find that he not only lives in the same palace of art as Homer and Isaiah, but lives in it at the same 
time."

PARADOX VI.--THE IMAGINATION REALISES WHAT IT INVENTS

"BEHOLD! the greatest magician in the universe! It is she who makes the memory yield its fruit, who realises beforehand 
the Possible, and invents even the Impossible. To her miracles cost nothing. She transports houses and mountains through 
the air, places whales in the sky, and stars in the sea, gives paradise to the hashish or opium eaters,, offers kingdoms 
to inebriates, and makes Perette dance with joy under the milk pail. Such is IMAGINATION."

DARE to CREATE your Dream Reality is going to Bee our magickal motto.

1. Grab a pen or a pencil, -unless you got a drawing tablet, it's better than using the mouse, but feel free to use the mouse if you prefer-,
and draw a picture of what it is for you that you would like to SEE happening worldwide next December 21 2012, 11:11.
Relax and allow your imagination to just fly: you can draw ANYTHING you feel like, you are not going to be judged for it.
Don't try to do something 'beautiful' just so that other anons admire your work: 
open your mind to whatever the Universe tells you and be HONEST about what you'd like to see happening.

It doesn't matter that you 'don't know' how to draw: remember when we were inhibited children, ALL OF US know how to draw, right!?

Only two rules in this game:

* You have to use these 4 colours only: BLACK, WHITE, YELLOW, RED.
* You have to include a BEE in your drawing.

2. When you are finished, scan it and upload it to your personal blog, to any image hosting site such as imgur.com or send it as an attachment by email.

3. To Find The Others, SHARE your Creation with the Bees in the Hive Mind, as other anons already did. See below.

Send your artwork to |=-------------------=[   anon ['@'] projectmayhem2012.org    ]=-------------------=|

If selected, we will be publishing your Magick Reality Hacking drawings in the next HiveMinds[].html
You can also post them to http://www.whatis-theplan.org/t1676-project-mayhem-2012 and anywhere you want as well.

Further clues will be unlocked when a minimum 10 anons publish their artwork.

Enantiodromia (Greek: ἐνάντιος, enantios, opposite + δρόμος, dromos, running course) is a principle 
introduced by psychiatrist Carl Jung that the superabundance of any force inevitably produces its opposite. It is 
equivalent to the principle of equilibrium in the natural world, in that any extreme is opposed by the system in order 
to restore balance. Though "enantiodromia" was coined by Jung, it is implied in the writings of Heraclitus. In fr. 126, 
for example, Heraclitus says "cold things warm, warm things cool, wet things dry and parched things get wet."[1] It also 
seems implicit in other of his sayings, like "war is father of all, king of all" (fr. 53), "they do not know that the 
differing/opposed thing agrees with itself; harmony is reflexive (παλίντροπος palintropos, used of a compound 
bow, or "in reflexive tension"), like the bow and the lyre" (fr. 51). In these passages and others the idea of the 
coincidence of opposites is clearly articulated in Heraclitus' characteristic riddling style, as well as the dynamic 
motion back and forth between the two, generated especially by opposition and conflict.

A smile to my face

It's good to know there are things like your project and the plan are going on (i just discovered them today). You see 
something so far away but slowly, slowly you recognize the steps as multiply and get closer to your feet. 

I want more than anything to find the light and i have a better grasp on it than most people.

"Fatherhood is unity disguised as duality". Truer words where never spoken. But in the spirit/astral world this is okay. 
Only logic survives, weather or not you do too depends on your ability to conform with logic. What happens when you lose 
that sense, and instead, everything survives? Losing your ego, your bias. Into a world where there is pretty much no 
inherent logic. You become spiritually....nothing. And they call this Nirvana lol

Robert Anton Wilson On the Illuminati
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson#On_the_Illuminati

Near the end of his life, Richard Metzger interviewed Robert Anton Wilson and asked him about the Illuminati.
His answer was:

"Richard Metzger: You have studied the Illuminati for years. Have you come to any conclusion about their aims?

Robert Anton Wilson:

Usually when people ask me that question, I give them some kind of a put-on, but I can't think of a good and original 
put-on that I haven't done several times before. So I'll tell you the truth, for once. After investigating the 
Illuminati and their critics for the last 30 years, I think the Illuminati was A SHORT LIVED SOCIETY OF FREE THINKERS 
AND DEMOCRATIC REFORMERS that formed a secret society within Freemasonry, using Freemasonry as a cover SO THEY COULD 
PLOT TO OVERTHROW ALL THE KINGS IN EUROPE AND THE POPE. 

I'm very happy that they succeeded in overthrowing all the kings, I just wish that they had completed the job and gotten 
rid of the Royal family in England too, but they did pretty well on the continent. I'm sorry they haven't finished off 
the Pope yet, either, but I think they're still working on the project and I WISH THEM LUCK."

"In the mid 1980s I was asked by an American legal institution known as the Christic Institute,
to compile a comic book which would detail the murky history of the CIA
from the end of the 2nd World War to the present day.
Covering things suchs as the heroine smuggling during the Vietnam War,
the cocaine smuggling during the war in Central America,
the Kennedy assasination and other highlights.
What I learned during the frankly horrifying research that I had to slug through to accomplish this,
was that, YES, THERE IS A CONSPIRACY, IN FACT THERE ARE A GREAT NUMBER OF CONSPIRACIES THAT ARE
ALL TRIPPING EACH OTHER UP.
And all of those conspiracies are run by paranoid fantasists and ham-fisted clowns.
If you are on a list targetet by the CIA, you really have nothing to worry about.
If however, you have a name similar to somebody on a list targeted by the CIA, then you are dead.

The main thing that I learned about conspiracy theory is that CONSPIRACY THEORISTS ACTUALLY
BELIEVE IN A CONSPIRACY BECAUSE THAT IS MORE COMFORTING.

The truth of the world is that IT IS CHAOTIC.

The truth is, that it is not the Jewish banking conspiracy
or the grey aliens or the 12 foot reptiloids from another dimension that are in control.

THE TRUTH IS FAR MORE FRIHTENING: NOBODY IS IN CONTROL.

The world is rudderless."

The graphic novel Brought to Light by writers Alan Moore and Joyce Brabner used material from lawsuits filed by the Christic Institute.

Brought to Light: Thirty Years of Drug Smuggling, Arms Deals, and Covert Action.

"The story of "Shadowplay" is of an unseen character (presumably representing the oblivious American public in 
first-person view of the reader) in a bar, where he is approached by a man-sized, walking, talking eagle. The eagle, 
from the emblem of the CIA, proceeds to drink alcohol and, in a drunken stupor, divulge all the bloody details of The 
Agency's sordid past. Early on a reference is made to the number of gallons an olympic swimming pool can hold, and the 
fact that an adult human body has one gallon of blood; from then on, the victims of CIA activities (directly or 
indirectly) are quantified in swimming pools filled with blood, each pool representing 20,000 dead. Sienkiewicz's dark, 
erratic, and blurry images keep the mood of Moore's narration (through the boozing eagle) unnerving, and hazily 
nightmarish."
