IF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING AND HAVE PEOPLE LISTEN THEN YOU HAVE TO WEAR A MASK.

If you want to be HONEST then you have to LIVE A LIE.

I like to think I have the guts to stand up anonymously in a western
democracy and call for things no-one else believes in - 
like Peace and Justice and Freedom."
— Banksy. Graffiti Ratist. PoeTic ERRORIST.

TREASON

A NATION CAN SURVIVE ITS FOOLS, AND EVEN THE AMBITIOUS.
BUT IT CANNOT SURVIVE TREASON FROM WITHIN.

An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and he carries
his banners openly. But the traitor moves among those within the gate freely,
his sly whispers rustling through all the galleys, heard in the very hall
of government itself.

FOR THE TRAITOR APPEARS NOT A TRAITOR —HE SPEAKS IN THE ACCENTS FAMILIAR
TO HIS VICTIMS, AND WEARS THEIR FACE AND THEIR GARMENT, AND HE APPEALS
TO THE BASENESS THAT LIES DEEP IN THE HEARTS OF ALL MEN.

He rots the soul of a nation—he works secretly and unknown in the night
to undermine the pillars of a city 
—HE INFECTS THE BODY POLITIC SO THAT IT CAN NO LONGER RESIST.

A murderer is less to be feared

Cicero, 42 B.C.E.

NEW HIVE MIND CHALLENGE!

#OP_ANONAMOOSE_HOMAGE

GRATITUDE is one of the MasterKeys that Opens ALL the Doors.

"There is no such thing as gratitude unexpressed.
If it is unexpressed, it is plain, old-fashioned ingratitude."

If the only prayer you said in your whole life was, "thank you," that would suffice.
Meister Eckhart

Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it.  ~William Arthur Ward

Most human beings have an almost infinite capacity for taking things for granted.  ~Aldous Huxley

Who does not thank for little will not thank for much.  ~Estonian Proverb

I feel a very unusual sensation - if it is not indigestion, I think it must be gratitude.  ~Benjamin Disraeli

If you want to turn your life around, try thankfulness:
It will change your life mightily.

Let's show ANONAMOOSE the GRATITUDE of the HIVE MIND for
out of pure ENTHUSIASM and only moved by his willingness to SHARE,
he has contribooted a great piece of ART to the Hive.

All the works sent to PM2012 are released completely for free and in the Public Domain:

Please show your gratitude to him for his action.

Even though PM2012 is a completeley autonomous player in The Game and not related to
PM2012 in any way, we would be more than pleased to have you send him some gifts.

Anonamoose: please feel free to let us know if you'd like us to publish en email for contact
or if you'd like to have a anonamoose [ '@' ] projectmayhem2012.org email alias instead, pointing to your actual email.
Be warned though, for our friends in the DHS might be more than happy to tag you as an EXTREMELY DANGEROUS and SUBVERSIVE poeTic ERRORIST!!!! };-D

If and when Anonamoose decides to register and let us know about a Bitcoin address,
we will inform you as to how you could show him your gratitude that way.

For the time being, let's all honour Anonamoose's great piece of Art by making a VIDEO using his 'Dangerous Idea Number One.mp3'

Available for download at:

http://projectmayhem2012.org/hivemindRATists.html

Let's make him PROUD of US!
Let's make something that MOVES him for what he has done: to move us deeply all in the PM2012 team.

Bee completely free to choose the theme, bee that a futuristic time, robots walking along dark alleys in the Aftermath of 12.21.2012 11:11,
retro, l33t-alike... surprise the hivemind with your sense of Beauty!
Don't bee afraid to stretch the limits, something funny as two eggs chatting or completely surrealist...
it does NOT need to have any 'meaning' or be understandable by all:
provided that you put ALL OF YOUR HEART in Creating the Seeds of Something Beautiful to pay tribute to our fellow Anonamoose!

Send your RATworks to our email.

Please write #OP_ANONAMOOSE_HOMAGE in the subject line.

* THE PROVERBS OF HELL *

William Blake. 1757–1827.


ALWAYS BE READY TO SPEAK YOUR MIND AND A BASE MAN WILL AVOID YOU.
WHAT IS NOW PROVED WAS ONCE ONLY IMAGINED.
IF OTHERS HAVE NOT BEEN FOOLISH, WE SHOULD BE SO.
THE ROAD OF EXCESS LEADS TO THE PALACE OF WISDOM. 
EXHUBERANCE IS BEAUTY.
When thou seest an Eagle, thou seest a portion of Genius. Lift up thy head!
The head, Sublime. The heart Pathos. THE GENITALS BEAUTY. The hands and feet: Proportion.
THE WEAK IN COURAGE IS STRONG IN CUNNING.

If you DARE to put its extremely simple wisdom into ACTIONS, then
you can TOTALLY FORGET about PM2012 after you have watched it.


The mushroom said to me once "Nature Loves Courage".

Nature LOVES courage. 

And I said "What's the pay off on that?" 

And it said, It shows you that it loves courage because

#OP_HOMAGE_TO_ARRABAL

Let's show Fernando Arrabal our deep gratitude for supporting Project Mayhem 2012 and the PM2012 team during our direst moments!

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a somewhat unusual bulletin warning the security community about the planned activities of hacking collective Anonymous over the next few months.

The Department of Homeland Security National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC),
is aware that Fernando Arrabal has publicly shown is support for Project Mayhem 2012 as an Artistic endeavour, a sculpture of Social Panic Art.

*********************************************************************************************************************************
*********************************************************************************************************************************
*****    We have received internal information that their bulletin fingerpointing PM2012 has totally backfired,              ****
*****  for now they FEAR that 'Dangerous Idea #1' might GO VIRAL if they decided to detain the members of the PM2012 team!!! ****
*********************************************************************************************************************************
*********************************************************************************************************************************

Let's have Milan Kundera's beautiful words on Arrabal be heard all over the world,

TEXT: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan_Kundera

"There are players who do not take anything seriously.
And there are men who openly challenge tribunals and prison.
However, on very few occasions do players appear who
not only do not take anything seriously but also challenge tribunals and prison.
Even when he challenges Franco or Castro, Arrabal is not antiestablishment
or a militant preacher.

HE IS A MAN WHO PLAYS.

HE CONCEIVES ART AS A GAME, AND THE WORLD IS TURNED INTO A GAME THE VERY MOMENT HE TOUCHES IT.

However, this century is a field of forbidden games, a trap set for players."

Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948, states that:

"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; THIS RIGHT 
INCLUDES FREEDOM TO HOLD OPINIONS WITHOUT INTERFERENCE AND TO SEEK, 
RECEIVE AND IMPART INFORMATION AND IDEAS THROUGH ANY MEDIA AND 
REGARDLESS OF FRONTIERS."

Today freedom of speech, or the freedom of expression, is recognized in 
international and regional human rights law. The right is enshrined in 
Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 13 of the 
American Convention on Human Rights and Article 9 of the African Charter 
on Human and Peoples' Rights. Based on John Milton's arguments, 
freedom of speech is understood as a multi-faceted right that includes 
not only the right to express, or disseminate, information and ideas, 
but three further distinct aspects: 

THE RIGHT TO SEEK INFORMATION AND ***** IDEAS *****;
THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE INFORMATION AND ***** IDEAS *****;
THE RIGHT TO IMPART INFORMATION AND ***** IDEAS *****.

International, regional and national standards also recognize that 
freedom of speech, as the freedom of expression, includes any medium, be 
it orally, in written, in print, THROUGH THE INTERNET OR THROUGH ART 
FORMS.

THIS MEANS THAT THE PROTECTION OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH AS A RIGHT 
INCLUDES NOT ONLY THE CONTENT, BUT ALSO THE MEANS OF EXPRESSION.

*****    WARNING: DHS outsourced DISINFO about PROJECT MAYHEM 2012    *****
***************************************************************************
***************************************************************************


The U.S. Department of Homeland Security National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC),
****** IS DISINFORMING AMERICAN CITIZENS & THE WORLD AT LARGE ****** by trying to link Project Mayhem 2012 with 
'physical disruption and targeting of information systems' which is TOTALLY and completely FALSE.

Computerworld.com Sr. Editor Jaikumar Vijayan REFUSES TO PROVIDE US WITH A COPY OF THAT SUPPOSED DHS BULLETIN, on the basis that:

______________________________________________________________________________

It does not appear to me that the DHS bulletin is publicly available yet.
The organization that I received the  bulletin from has requested confidentiality.

[endquote]
______________________________________________________________________________

DHS warns of planned Anonymous attacks
Bulletin from feds highlights group's Occupy Wall Street, Operation Facebook, Project Mayhem campaigns

The two other planned attacks by Anonymous that are highlighted in the 
bulletin are, Operation Facebook a November 11 protest targeting the 
social media site for its alleged privacy violations, AND PROJECT 
MAYHEM, SCHEDULED FOR DEC 21, 2012. 

Though there has been little dialogue or hints about the specific 
tactics, techniques and procedures that Anonymous plans to employ for 
Project Mayhem there are indications that it could involve physical 
disruption and targeting of information systems. 

The name Project Mayhem is derived from the movie Fight Club in which 
"the main character is ultimately responsible for destroying buildings 
belonging to major financial institutions with explosives," the bulletin 
said.

Jaikumar Vijayan has admitted to us that he has 'PARAPHRASED' the supposedly original DHS bulletin:


[quote]
______________________________________________________________________________

Ref your question about this sentence: Though there has been little 
dialogue or hints about the specific tactics, techniques and procedures 
that Anonymous plans to employ for Project Mayhem there are indications 
that it could involve physical disruption and targeting of information 
systems. 

That is a paraphrase of the DHS comentary. This is the actual phrasing 
from the DHS bulletin as it relates to Project mayhem. 

1) "Project Mayhem, (PM) was announced by Anonymous in August 2011, and 
according to their public website projectmayhem2012[dot]org, is set to 
culminate on 21 December 2012" 

2)" Furthermore, there is no dialogue or hints as to specific tactics, 
techniques and procedures (TTP) that Anonymous plans on employing on or 
prior to 21 December 2012. There are also several seemingly related 
internet wiki-style portals and web forums, operating under the PM name, 
devoted to discussing random malicious acts - some involving physical 
disruption and some involving targeting information systems - but no 
direct discussion of attack scenarios."" 

{{{A footnote attached to this statement says this: "Several of these 
wikis and portals discuss coordination on 4chan[dot]org and other known 
Anonymous collaboration sites."}}}} 

3)""The name “Project Mayhem” is derived from the popular 1999 film 
Fight Club. The project refers to a secret operation carried out by the 
Fight Club to topple the corporate American system. In the movie, the 
Club carries out numerous malicious acts such as defacement of buildings 
with graffiti, sabotage, and arson. In the finale, the main character is 
ultimately responsible for destroying buildings belonging to major 
financial institutions with explosives." 

Hopefully this clarifies some of your questions.

PM2012 would like to remind Mr. Jaikumar Vijayan that:

In Lovell v. City of Griffin, 303 U.S. 444 (1938), Chief Justice Hughes 
defined the press as, "every sort of publication which affords a vehicle 
of information and opinion."

This includes everything from newspapers to blogs.
 
Freedom of the press, like freedom of speech, is SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON BASES SUCH AS ***** DEFAMATION LAW. ***** 

Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 generally 
immunizes from liability parties that create forums on the Internet in 
which defamation occurs from liability for statements published by third 
parties. THIS HAS THE EFFECT OF PRECLUDING ALL LIABILITY FOR STATEMENTS 
MADE BY PERSONS ON THE INTERNET WHOSE IDENTITY CANNOT BE DETERMINED. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_defamation_law


Mr. Jaikumar Vijayan has refused to acknowledge the fact that Nobeli Prize finalist Fernando Arrabal
[ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Arrabal ], 
creator with Alejandro Jodorowsky and Roland Topor of Panic Movement

[ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_Movement ]

has shown publicly his support for Project Mayhem 2012 as a sculpture of Social Panic Art
from his personal blog at http://laregledujeu.org/arrabal/

“…el Papa baila con Zaratustra , ya que su solteri’a es cada vez menos hereditaria…”

… hemos concebido Project Mayhem 2012 como una escultura de Arte Social Pánico y como un Juego de Hacking de Realidad Alternativa al más puro estilo  Arrabal/  Fluxus / Joseph Beuys.
 … “Un juego de realidad alternativa (en inglés Alternate Reality Game) es una narración interactiva que utiliza el mundo real como soporte, presentando una serie de recursos mediáticos reales para contar una historia que se ve afectada por la intervención de los participantes.

 … Sin que exista un consenso globalizado para definir el concepto, parece claro que se encuentra en un punto medio entre un juego y un conjunto de puzzles. Se ha descrito como la primera forma narrativa nacida de internet, porque su esencia suele radicar en buscar y compartir información.”
 … “Reality hacking is a term used to describe any phenomenon which emerges from the nonviolent use of illegal or legally ambiguous digital tools in pursuit of politically, socially or culturally subversive ends.”
 … Sin embargo, como bien sabemos, no hay nada más peligroso en el Universo que una Obra de Arte elevada a la categoría de Espejo…
 … Con mucho gusto quedamos a  la  entera disposición  de ARRABAL  para cualquier aclaración que estime oportuna.
 … Reciba el PANICO DE ARRABAL nuestro más entrañable saludo,   PM2012

#OPTYLER_TIGER_TEAM

According to a 1964 definition, it has been described as
'a team of undomesticated and uninhibited technical specialists,
selected for their experience, energy, and imagination,
and assigned to track down relentlessly every 
possible source of failure in a spacecraft subsystem.'" 
Security tiger teams

In security work, a TIGER TEAM is a specialized group that tests an 
organization's ability to protect its assets by attempting to 
circumvent, defeat, or otherwise thwart that organization's internal and 
external security. The term originated within the military to describe a 
team whose purpose is to penetrate security of "friendly" installations 
to test security measures.[citation needed] It now more generally refers 
to any team that attacks a problem aggressively

"There's nothing more dangerous than someone who wants to make the world a better place.
If you want to say something and have people listen then you have to wear a MASK.
If you want to be HONEST then you have to LIVE A LIE.

I like to think I have the guts to stand up anonymously in a western
democracy and call for things no-one else believes in - 
like Peace and Justice and Freedom."

TREASON

A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious.
But it cannot survive treason from within.

An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and he carries
his banners openly. But the traitor moves among those within the gate freely,
his sly whispers rustling through all the galleys, heard in the very hall
of government itself.

For the traitor appears not a traitor —he speaks in the accents familiar
to his victims, and wears their face and their garment, and he appeals
to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men.

He rots the soul of a nation—he works secretly and unknown in the night
to undermine the pillars of a city —he infects the body politic so that
it can no longer resist.

A murderer is less to be feared

Steven Pinker: 'IN DEFENSE OF DANGEROUS IDEAS'

"Dangerous ideas are likely to confront us at an increasing rate and we are
ill equipped to deal with them. When done right, science (together with
other truth-seeking institutions, such as history and journalism)
characterizes the world as it is, without regard to whose feelings get
hurt.
[...]
Also, IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE ANY ASPECT OF PUBLIC LIFE WHERE IGNORANCE OR
DELUSION IS BETTER THAN AN AWARENESS OF THE TRUTH, EVEN AN UNPLEASANT ONE."

'In defense of dangerous ideas' by Steven Pinker.

To get ready for the ÜberLVLZ and to SPOT HIDDEN Project Mayhem 2012 anons in teh ÜberLVLZ CLVB,
from today to 12.21.2012 11:11, whenever it's 11:11 a.m. local time, DO THIS:

1. Program the ALARM in your wristwatch to be triggered at EVERYDAY at 11:11 sharp.
If you hear other alarms around you, you'll know you are in the presence of another PM2012 dormant cell
waiting 4 teh ÜberLVLZ.

LET'S TROLL THE SHIT OUT OF FELLOW MATRIX DRONES AROUND US!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If they ask you why did you program the ALARM at 11:11, EVERYDAY, INVENT A LIE!!!!!!!!!!!

Or give them a COMPLETELY SURREALISTIC answer: 

say a PASSWORD phrase, like this:

"I have a RED PILL to take at 11:11 everyday. I have a strange feeling in my stomach.
It hurts me a little bit when I laugh."

If the person who asked you why do you set your alarm clock at 11:11 a.m. everyday is another fellow
PM2012 RAT, they will find out. Wink or slightly touch your *** LEFT EYE *** BOTH OF YOU ***.
That way you both will know that you are PM2012 RATs and can wait until a safer time to CONSPIRE. };-)


REPEAT every day at 11:11 a.m. until you spot fellow PM2012 dormant cells: your goal is
TO FIND AS MANY "THE OTHERS" AS POSSIBLE.

When you spot a fellow PM2012 RAT dormant cell, exchange emails / Facebook / Twitter.

Both of you two, PM2012 RATs, remain as stealthy as possible. DON'T SPEAK about PM2012 with
your lifetime friends UNLESS *** THEY NATURALLY FIND OUT ABOUT and RESONATE with PM2012 ***.

But WAIT until they show a POSITIVE attitude towards what PM2012 stands for.

BEEWARE of MATRIX DRONES!!! They will suspect you are onto something.
Invent EXCUSES. LIVE A LIE.

Don't tell ANYBODY about PM2012 unless the MATRIX DRONES ****** NATURALLY RESONATE ***** with
PM2012 by themselves.

Then give them a warm & lulzy welcome and remain in contact with them in STEALTH MODE:

VERY SPECIALLY, do *NOT* talk about PM2012 over email, for your girlfriend/boyfriends might
find out.

DO *NOT* TELL YOUR BOYFRIEND/GIRLFRIEND about PM2012 unless *THEY* independently find out
about PM2012, via coinciDANCES mostly... Don't worry, you'll know what we mean when everybody
starts to experience extreme MINDFUCKS around anything PM2012 related!!!! mwuaaahahahahahh!!
};-)

2. If you don't wear a wristband alarm clock (GOOD PERSONAL LIFE CHOICE, TO HELL WITH CLOCKS!!!!!),
then LEARN the music and the lyrics in SPANISH of the Alejandro Jodorowsky's song:

Alejandro Jodorowsky. Holy Blood - The End of the World OST theme.
Alejandro Jodorowsky. Santa Sangre - El Fin del Mundo. Canción.

EL FIN DEL MUNDO SE ACERCA YA
Toda esperanza se acabará
YA LAS SEÑALES SE ESTÁN CUMPLIENDO
Se están cumpliendo como escrito está
QUERIDO AMIGO, LIRIO TE LLAMA
No hagas duro tu corazón
RÍNDETE A LIRIO, DALE TU ALMA
Y tendrás parte en la resurrección

http://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=I0lEySHkqik

You can either start to sing it low at 11:11 or 11:11 P.M. sharp or to WHISTLE the melody lowly.

...or, depending on how much FEAR have you been losing lately,
as LOUD and stupidly as you feel like, of course!!! };-)

Say to people that it's a song about THE END OF THE WORLD.

They will know there might be something wrong with your head....
Depending on how FOOL and CRAZY you are prepared to look like in front of other people,
you can play the game along, and say, that you've been hearing "voices" or "messages in TV",
as flashes that look like two 11:11 numbers, or flashes with the words PM2012, or PM2012 written
very tiny in the right corner of a product placement in TV... or as an unfocused painting on a background wall...
...or you might suddenly spot the PM2012 HIVE MIND mascot, FAQU, printed in a T-SHIRT that a mainstream
young and sexy TV presenter is wearing... 

...you get the idea. };-)


Or, depending of your level of FEAR to ridicule, you can actually SING IT OUT LOUD.

You'll know that you are doing progress to kill your FEARS when you realize that as time
passes by, you don't fucking care about SINGING OUT LOUD "EL FIN DEL MUNDO SE ACERCA YA"
in spanish in your workplace, neighbourhood or local church, for YOU ARE SLOWLY LOSING THE CHAINS!!

Everybody, memorize and repeat with us!

When you spot a fellow PM2012 RAT, repeat the procedure:

******************************************************************************
***************     HOW TO IDENTIFY A FELLOW PM2012 RAT     ******************
*****   WINK THEM or slightly touch YOUR LEFT EYE with your fingers      *****
******************************************************************************
******************************************************************************

Then exchange Facebook / Twitter / emails and remain STEALTHY in contact
until you hear a certain signal that will be revealed soon. When that happens,
ALL PM2012 RATs in spread around the world will DO something in synchrony:

FOR INSTANCE, WE ***ALL*** WILL DO SOMETHING COMPLETELY *** STUPID *** at
11:11 a.m. that day, something that BREAKS the laws of "rationality", something
that looks SO TOTALLY out of place that people around us might think that
we have gone CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!! 

When, in REALITY ...WE WILL BE TROLLING THEIR ARSES OFF!!!!!!!!!!! 

                               };-)))
			       
			       
	       YESSSSSS, IT'S FUCKING EVIL, WE KNOE!!!!

If several people in the same place happen to do the very similar thing at
11:11, it means that you are surrounded by fellow PM2012 RATs.

Again, when that happens,

******************************************************************************
***************     HOW TO IDENTIFY A FELLOW PM2012 RAT     ******************

******************************************************************************

That's called a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge-response_authentication

};-)

Again, wait for a safe time when you two are alone and not surrounded by
other MATRIX DRONES, and exchange contacts.

LIE to other people about why you have "Liked" that PM2012 page.
Tell them it just looks cool, or it has nice graphics and music, and the
clock seems intriguing and you'd like to find out what's gonna happen that day
but JUST THAT. DO *** NOT *** try to gain other MATRIX DRONES for the PM2012
Hive Mind. Either they resonate by themselves or they are going to slowly
be MINDFUCKED moar and moar as we approach 12.21.2012 11:11!!! 

        TROLOLOLOLOTROLOLOLOLOTROLOLOLOLOTROLOLOLOLO!!!!!!! };-)

It is ****** VERY IMPORTANT ***** that you do *** NOT *** discuss PM2012
with fellow PM2012 RATs unless you use a particular CODED GLOSSARY that we
will be revealing soon.

It's A SECRET LANGUAGE that only fellow PM2012 RATs will understand.

We will advance you just 3 words:

In the middle of a conversation, or at a big PARTY, if you want to find out
how many PM2012 RATs are around you, you can shout out loud:

*******************************************************************
***************     ANYBODY GOT A RED LIGHTER????   ***************     
*******************************************************************

Of course it's a DUMBFUCK question... but you WILL know how many PM2012 RATs
are around you without anybody knowing.

THEN try to spot people touching their LEFT EYES or WINKING their
LEFT EYES at you.

Of course you might have been targetted by a fellow MATRIX DRONE.

To verify that they KNOW about PM2012, ask them the following:

*******************************************************************
*****   Hey, I'm curious, what do you know about ZARATHUSTRA? *****
*******************************************************************

If they are another PM2012 RAT, they will answer you back:

*******************************************************************
*****   Well, they confounded the POET with the HERO.         *****
*******************************************************************
  
BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM! Another fellow PM2012 RAT.


With this PM2012 RATs Secret Language, you will be able to safely exchange

Imagine you are surrounded by a group of people.
They are UTTER strangers,
yet they have something in common that you don't.
They look suspicious.
They look sirius.
Yet sometimes they do teh lulz for no apparent reason.
You always loved to play it safe.
You always loved to be a grown up.
You always loved to be respected.
You always loved to be feared.
You always loved to be IN CONTROL.
Yet they seem to do...things.
You don't understand why they do those...things.
You are starting to believe that if so many people is acting so weird...
...then, if we define Reality as:


Consensus reality is an approach to answering the philosophical question 
"WHAT IS REAL?" 

It gives a practical answer: 

REALITY IS EITHER WHAT EXISTS, OR WHAT WE CAN AGREE SEEMS TO EXIST.

The process has been (perhaps loosely and a bit imprecisely) characterised 
as:

*************************************************************************************
*****   "WHEN ENOUGH PEOPLE THINK SOMETHING IS TRUE, IT... TAKES ON A LIFE OF   *****
*****                               ITS OWN."                                   *****
*************************************************************************************


 The term is usually used disparagingly as by 
implication it may mean little more than "what a group or culture 
chooses to believe," and may bear little or no relationship to any "true 
reality," and, indeed, challenges the notion of "true reality." 


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_reality
You are starting to believe


your personal NETWORK of PM2012 connections is feeding and ENRICHENING the PM2012 EGREGOR!!!

and keep in contact with them.

GOLDEN RULE in finding fellow PM2012 RATs:

*************************************************************************************************
**** DO **** NOT **** TRY **** TO **** PERSUADE **** ANYONE **** TO **** JOIN **** PM2012!!! ****
*************************************************************************************************

Just...

                                     brilla. ~♥~ shine on.


Just PATIENTLY wait until they find themselves laughing about PM2012 and BEGGING to join teh LVLZ!

<!--
'If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property,
it is the action of the thinking power called

AN IDEA

which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself;
but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of everyone, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it.
Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it.

He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.

That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition,
seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space,
without lessening their density at any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation.
Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.'

Thomas Jefferson, in letter to Isaac McPherson, 1813.
-->
<!--
1.  Ideas aren't physical. Regardless of the legalities, treating ideas as possessions insults their vast combustive power. Jefferson put it best:
    'The moment an idea is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of everyone, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it.
	 He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.'
2.  Ideas aren't worth jack unless other people can put them to use.
3.  Ideas won't change the world unless others can improve on them.
4.  Ideas grow by participation, not isolation.
5.  Ideas change as they grow. Their core remains the same, but their scope enlarges with successful use.
6.  Ideas have unexpected results. No one person can begin to imagine all the results of a good idea. That's another reason to welcome participation.
7.  Nobody's going to "steal" your ideas, any more than they can steal your cerebrum. You're the source. Authority over the idea begins with you.
8.  Authority derives from originality and respect. You can't get respect for your original ideas unless those ideas prove useful to others.
9.  There are two reasons other people are going to "steal" your ideas. First, the only people qualified to steal your ideas are too busy trying to get their own ideas to work.
    Second, they already don't like your idea because it's not their idea. (But if your idea gets traction, maybe then they'll start to respect it.)
10. In the software world, patents are hand-held nuclear weapons. They may have some deterrent or "defensive" purposes, but they tend to hurt those who use them at least as much as they hurt others.
    Where would Linux be if Linus Tovalds decided to make it a proprietary OS? Where would RSS, blogging, podcasting or outlining be today if Dave Winer had locked his ideas behind patents?

"I don’t have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. It’s a depression. Everybody’s out of work or scared of losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel’s work, banks are going bust, shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter. Punks are running wild in the street and there’s nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there’s no end to it.
We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat, and we sit watching our TV’s while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that’s the way it’s supposed to be. We know things are bad – worse than bad. They’re crazy. It’s like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don’t go out anymore.
We sit in the house, and slowly the world we are living in is getting smaller, and all we say is, “Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials and I won’t say anything. Just leave us alone.”
Well, I’m not gonna leave you alone. I want you to get mad! I don’t want you to protest. I don’t want you to riot – I don’t want you to write to your congressman because I wouldn’t know what to tell you to write. I don’t know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street. All I know is that first you’ve got to get mad.
You’ve got to say, “I’m a human being, God damn it! My life has value!”
So I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window. Open it, and stick your head out, and yell, 
“I’M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I’M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!”

PM2012 TEAM: WEAK MEMORY TO PEE.

Some of PM2012 team members 'work' (for we truly see this as EXTREME PLEASURE) 18-20 hour days.
Other days, some PM2012 simply don't sleep.

Sometimes we forget to eat. To shower. Or to pee.

Recently, the DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC),
has warned financial services companies especially to be on the lookout for attempts by
Anonymous to "SOLICIT IDEOLOGICALLY DISSATISFIED, SYMPATHETIC EMPLOYEES" to their cause.

DHS WARNS OF PLANNED ANONYMOUS ATTACKS
Bulletin from feds highlights group's Occupy Wall Street, Operation Facebook, Project Mayhem campaigns
By Jaikumar Vijayan
September 2, 2011 12:40 PM ET

"The two other planned attacks by Anonymous that are highlighted in the 
bulletin are [...] AND PROJECT MAYHEM, SCHEDULED FOR DEC 21, 2012.

Though there has been little dialogue or hints about the specific 
tactics, techniques and procedures that Anonymous plans to employ for 
PROJECT MAYHEM THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT IT COULD INVOLVE PHYSICAL 
DISRUPTION AND TARGETING OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS. 

The name Project Mayhem is derived from the movie Fight Club in which 
"THE MAIN CHARACTER IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR DESTROYING BUILDINGS 
BELONGING TO MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH EXPLOSIVES," the bulletin said."
