'The tigers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction.
Great things are done when men and mountains meet.
What is grand is necessarily obscure to weak men. That which can be made explicit to the idiot is not worth my care.
Energy is an eternal delight, and he who desires, but acts not, breeds pestilence.
Do what thou Wilt, this world's a fiction and is made up of contradiction.'

Account of the Sarmoun Brotherhood
Desmond R. Martin, 1965:

"There are many legends about Sarmoun-Dargauh ('COURT OF THE BEES'), and one of them is this. True knowledge, it is 
asserted, exists as a positive commodity, like the honey of the bee. Like honey, it can be accumulated. From time to 
time in human history, however, it lies unused and starts to leak away. On those occasions the Sarmouni and their 
associates all over the world collect it and store it in a special receptacle. Then, when the time is ripe, they release 
it into the world again, through specially trained emissaries."

'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from MAGIC.'

Arthur C. Clarke, "Profiles of The Future", 1961 (Clarke's third law)
English physicist & science fiction author (1917 - )


'The Duhem–Quine thesis (also called the Duhem–Quine problem, after Pierre Duhem and Willard Van Orman Quine) is that it 
is impossible to test a scientific hypothesis in isolation, because an empirical test of the hypothesis requires one or 
more background assumptions (also called auxiliary assumptions or auxiliary hypotheses).

The hypothesis in question is by itself incapable of making predictions. Instead, the consequences of the hypothesis 
typically rest on background assumptions from which to derive predictions. This prevents a theory from becoming 
conclusively falsified through empirical means if the background assumptions are not proven (since background 
assumptions sometimes involve one or more scientific theories). For instance, to "disprove" the idea that the Earth is 
in motion, some people noted that birds did not get thrown off into the sky whenever they let go of a tree branch. That 
datum is no longer accepted as empirical evidence that the Earth is not moving because we have adopted a different 
background system of physics that allows us to make different predictions. Although a bundle of theories (i.e. a theory 
and its background assumptions) as a whole can be tested against the empirical world and be falsified if it fails the 
test, the Duhem–Quine thesis says it is impossible to isolate a single hypothesis in the bundle. One solution to the 
dilemma thus facing scientists is that when we have rational reasons to accept the background assumptions as true (e.g. 
scientific theories via evidence) we will have rational—albeit nonconclusive—reasons for thinking that the theory tested 
is probably wrong if the empirical test fails.' 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duhem%E2%80%93Quine_thesis

"W. V. Quine's paper Two Dogmas of Empiricism, published in 1951, is one of the most celebrated papers of twentieth 
century philosophy in the analytic tradition. According to Harvard professor of philosophy Peter Godfrey-Smith, this 
"paper [is] sometimes regarded as THE MOST IMPORTANT IN ALL OF TWENTIETH-CENTURY PHILOSOPHY". The paper is an attack 
on two central parts of the logical positivists' philosophy. One is the analytic-synthetic distinction between analytic 
truths and synthetic truths, explained by Quine as truths grounded only in meanings and independent of facts, and truths 
grounded in facts. The other is reductionism, the theory that each meaningful statement gets its meaning from some 
logical construction of terms that refers exclusively to immediate experience.

Quine's holism 

Instead of reductionism, Quine proposes that it is the whole field of science and not single statements that are 
verified. All scientific statements are interconnected. Logical laws give the relation between different statements, 
while they also are statements of the system. This makes talk about the empirical content of a single statement 
misleading. It also becomes impossible to draw a line between synthetic statements, which depend on experience, and 
analytic statements, that hold come what may. Any statement can be held as necessarily true according to Quine, if the 
right changes are made somewhere else in the system. In the same way, NO STATEMENTS ARE IMMUNE TO REVISION."

Magical paradigm shifting

Perhaps the most striking feature of chaos magic is the concept of the magical paradigm shift. 
Borrowing a term from philosopher Thomas Samuel Kuhn, Carroll made the technique of arbitrarily changing one's world 
view (or paradigm) of magic, a major concept of chaos magic. An example of a magical paradigm shift is doing a 
Lovecraftian rite, followed by using a technique from an Edred Thorsson book in the following ritual. These two magical 
paradigms are very different, but while the individual is using one, he or she believes in it fully to the extent of 
ignoring all other (often contradictory) ones. The shifting of magical paradigms has since found its way into the 
magical work of practitioners of many other magical traditions, but chaos magic remains the field where it is most 
developed. 

Changing belief systems at will is also sometimes practiced by followers of Discordianism. Some chaos 
magicians like to operate in what is sometimes called a meta-paradigm. This is much akin to syncretism but with the 
consideration that flexibility of belief is a means of personal power and freedom. A more or less syncretic reality 
tunneling. Even more removed from this, being a post-meta-paradigmatic view, or an abstention from the notion of any 
view being absolute, compare Nietzsche's Perspectivism.

Belief as a tool

Chaos magic claims that belief can be an  active magical force. It emphasizes flexibility of belief and the ability
to consciously choose one's beliefs, hoping to apply belief as a tool rather than seeing it as a relatively unchanging
part of one's personality.[8] Various psychological techniques are employed in order to induce flexibility of belief.
Other chaos magicians suggest that people do not need "belief" to work magic. Austin Osman Spare asserts in the Book
of Pleasure and various other works that Will formulates Desire which promulgates Belief. "

We are entering a new era: the End of all Secrets.
No more 'occult' secrets anymore neither.
Whenever magic is needed to help Human kind to evolve, the veils disappear. 

We are in an Emergency situation.

For the past 3 years, so called 'Initiates' from many different traditions have begun to SHARE ALL of their secrets,
worldwide, right now, as you are reading these words.

The role of Anonymous in the world is MUCH much bigger than the sum of all the bees in the Hive.

Everything will be revealed in time.

For now, read this:


Welcome to The Game.

By continuing to play this game, know that you have freely chosen to FOLLOW THE WHITE RABBIT.
Otherwise, you are completeley free to STOP and FORGET about this.

If you REALLY want to become a magician, the gates are fully open. Time is ripe.

It's extremeley simple: declare yourself one, right NOW, as Alan Moore did. As our fellow anon just did, with successful results.

Educate yourself: read what other magicians have written on the subject.

Then forget if you got it 'right' or 'wrong' and DARE to begin to PLAY. The single MOST important skill of the Magician is his IMAGINATION.

Don't just copy what others have tried. You do NOT need to follow any 'old age' rituals. Dare to be CREATIVE. Dare to create your own 'rituals'.
DARE to CREATE your own symbols.
DARE to CREATE your own games.
DARE to CREATE your own rules.
DARE to DISOBEY your own rules.
DARE to LAUGH about it ALL.

If necessary, FAKE the fact that you are a magician until you get results: PLAY to pretend. The Metaverse is the Great Pretender.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywZmQ2rg7GQ

The sigils technique is shown as it's one of the simplest ones yet more effective. It was developed by Chaos Magician Austin Osman Spare one century ago.

1. QUESTION EVERYTHING: don't just believe anything you read on this site, past, present or future.
2. TEST your assumptions.
3. LAUGH about results.
4. SHARE with THE OTHERS what you have learnt.
V. Repeat.

Fiat LVX, anons!
