'The tigers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction.
Great things are done when men and mountains meet.
What is grand is necessarily obscure to weak men. That which can be made explicit to the idiot is not worth my care.
Energy is an eternal delight, and he who desires, but acts not, breeds pestilence.
Do what thou Wilt, this world's a fiction and is made up of contradiction.'

If I may...

I would like to throw something else in as well, if it's not too much to ask for.

Face your shadow.

Facing yourself is the most hardest thing ever, and that is one of the ways those in power that are corrupt that are promoting.

They give your shadow it's most needed element, fear.

How do we beat it? Easy, take away the fear and replace it with love.

The more there is fear, the more we become separated and alone causing all kinds of problems, that is why there are wars and discrimination.
But if there is love, and a WHOLE LOT OF LOVE, invite your friends to a Bar B' Q, and invite their friends to that gathering as well.
Might be one of the easy ways to get to know more people, and in turn you won't feel alone or powerless.

With love, fear has no place.

Some say, "I fear God." or "I fear so-and-so." which is understandable. But why not replace that word "fear" with "love"? "I love God." "I love so-and-so.".

See how more positive it is?

This is one of the tools that those in power that are corrupt use to keep us in our homes, on this planet, to stop the progression of new ideas, etc.. 

So once again I would like to throw this idea out and give everyone that is reading this,

Face your shadow.

The strategic adversary is fascism.
The fascism IN US ALL, in our heads and in our everyday behavior,
the fascism that causes us to love power, to desire the very thing that dominates and exploits us.

There are more IDEAS on earth than intellectuals imagine.
And these IDEAS are more ACTIVE, STRONGER, more RESISTANT, more PASSIONATE than ''politicians'' think.
We have to be there at the birth of IDEAS, the bursting outward of their force:
not in books expressing them, but in events manifesting this force, in struggles carried on around IDEAS,
for or against them.

Michel Foucault (1926-1984).

My Shadow
Change is coming.
Now is my time.

Lie, kill and give and to
Die, learn and Love and to
Do what it takes to step through.
