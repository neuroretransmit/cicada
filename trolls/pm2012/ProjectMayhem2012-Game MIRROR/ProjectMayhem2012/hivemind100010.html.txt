'The tigers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction.
Great things are done when men and mountains meet.
What is grand is necessarily obscure to weak men. That which can be made explicit to the idiot is not worth my care.
Energy is an eternal delight, and he who desires, but acts not, breeds pestilence.
Do what thou Wilt, this world's a fiction and is made up of contradiction.'
William Blake

"I am interested in the picture as it seems to be a tarot card 
depiction and the protagonist in the picture seems to be holding 
a beehive in his left hand. /b/ees have an important significance 
in hermetic tradition 

Sacred bee-maidens with their gift of prophecy, were to be 
Apollo’s gift to Hermes, the god who alone could lead the souls 
of the dead out of life and sometimes back again. The etymology 
of the word fate in Greek offers a fascinating example of how the 
genius of the Minoan vision entered the Greek language, often 
visibly, as well as informing its stories of goddesses and gods. 
The Greek word for fate, death and goddess of death is e ker 
(feminine); the word for heart and breast is to ker (neuter); 
while the word for honeycomb is to kerion (neuter). The common 
root ker links the ideas fo the honeycomb, goddess, death, fate 
and the human heart, a nexus of meanings that is illumined if we 
know that the goddess was once imagined as a bee. 

In Greece: Great Mother was known as the Queen Bee, and her 
priestesses were called Melissae, the Bees. Bees were the emblem 
of Eros*, Demeter, Cybele, Diana, Rhea, and Artemis. The Pythian 
priestess at Delphi was known as the Delphic Bee.

infact the title "beekeper" was bestowed upon the pharoahs of 
egypt 

“Go to the bee, and learn how diligent she is, and what a noble 
work she produces; whose labour kings and private men use for 
their health. She is desired and honoured by all, and, though 
weak in strength, yet since she values wisdom she prevails.” 
The title of ‘Beekeeper’ was held by Egyptian Pharaohs.

now the thing is morrison and other Kaos/chaos magicians claim to 
have communicated with entities from sirius(don't worry I wont 
stay on this tangeant too long but it does tie into the bees 
thing) and if you watch the video with Alan Moore claiming he has 
been talking to his "imaginary friends" about the 
Apocalypse/revalation maybe he has been too...back to the 
bees...we are a hivemind afterall 

The bee and the beehive are connected to Diana/Artemis/Hecate 
worship. Hecate is depicted with snake feet and snakes for hair. 
Dogs, the sacred animal of Hecate, were sacrificed to her in 
rituals during the dark phrase of the moon...The ancient Egyptian 
word and hieroglyph for goddess als means serpent and the 
hieroglyph for Sirius means tooth. The Egyptian word for tooth 
also means dog and more specifically dog-god.This connection 
between honey and the dog/sirius will be seen in more detail 
below. Bees & the Merovingian bloodline 

Then from J.R. Church’s Guardians of the Grail 

In the tomb of Childeric I, son of Merovee, a special set of 300 
miniature golden bees were found. Napoleon affixed these bees to 
his coronation robe. The Mormons use the symbol of the bee and 
also hold to the doctrine that Yahshua of Nazareth married Mary 
Magdalene. It is believed that the Merovingians used the bee 
symbol because of the connection to Samson. Samson was known for 
the power that came from his long hair. So too, the Merovingian 
kings were known as the long haired kings which claimed their 
hair was the source of their occult powers 

Check out the length of Alan Moores hair and glorious beard! 

Also from Guardians of the Grail 

Four symbols are used in the Bible concerning the Danites – a 
serpent, an eagle, a lion, and the bees. In the story of Samons, 
we find the famous riddle of the bees who made honey in the 
carcass of a lion which had been killed by Samson. the symbolic 
nature of the bees could represent the concept that the 
descendants of the tribe of Dan would one day try to bring about 
the destruction of the tribe of Judah, whose symbol was the lion, 
and from the carcass of the lion the tribe of Dan would attempt 
to produce the golden age of a world empire, symbolized by the 
honey 

to find out more about the connection between the hermetic 
tradition and bees (plus a really interesting/ and sometimes odd 
alternative history of the world) check out this site 
http://drakenberg.weebly.com/medieval-legacy.html 

and from this site also comes a quote which can be applied to the 
hivemind and it's realisation of conciousness 

"The mind reveals the One. The mind can blend and fuse the form 
and life. Thou art the One. Thou art the form. Thou art the mind. 
Know this." 

ok off to do some more delving
