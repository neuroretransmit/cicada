If some entity wants to link Project Mayhem 2012 with calling for illegal deeds to be committed,
then KNOW that they are simply DISINFORMING you.
 
ALWAYS demand that "journalists" or other corporate/governmental institutions
PROVE their assertions about PM2012 and back them up with FACTUAL DATA
found inside the cryptographically signed -for, if it is not cryptographicall signed
with the PM2012 team key, it is NOT ours- literature found at Project Mayhem 2012 site,
for they will find NONE.

Each object served by PM2012 has got an associated cryptographic signature: a .sig file.
Append that to the end of the filename to cryptographically verify its authenticity and integrity.

i.e.: 

http://projectmayhem2012.org/hivemind10001001.gif -> http://projectmayhem2012.org/hivemind10001001.gif.sig
http://projectmayhem2012.org/hivemind11001010010.html -> http://projectmayhem2012.org/hivemind11001010010.html.sig

If it hasn't got an .sig that correctly verifies with the PM2012 public key,
then the file has either been corrupted on download or it's been forged or it simply is NOT coming from PM2012 team.

"In 1962 Arrabal co-founded the Panic Movement with Alejandro Jodorowsky 
and Roland Topor, inspired by the god Pan, and was elected Transcendent 
Satrap of the Collège de Pataphysique in 1990. Forty other Transcendent 
Satraps have been elected over the past half-century, including Marcel 
Duchamp, Eugène Ionesco, Man Ray, Boris Vian, Dario Fo, Umberto Eco and 
Jean Baudrillard. 

A friend of Andy Warhol and Tristan Tzara, Arrabal spent three years as 
a member of André Breton’s surrealist group." 

In 2001, he was runner-up for the Premio Cervantes, nominated by Nobel 
Prize in Literature Camilo José Cela and José Hierro.

He was  reportedly a FINALIST FOR THE NOBEL PRIZE IN 2005,
a prize which several institutions and personalities solicited for him.
On July 14, 2005, he was named to France’s Légion d'honneur.

Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948, states that:

"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; THIS RIGHT 
INCLUDES FREEDOM TO HOLD OPINIONS WITHOUT INTERFERENCE AND TO SEEK, 
RECEIVE AND IMPART INFORMATION AND IDEAS THROUGH ANY MEDIA AND 
REGARDLESS OF FRONTIERS."

Today freedom of speech, or the freedom of expression, is recognized in 
international and regional human rights law. The right is enshrined in 
Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 13 of the 
American Convention on Human Rights and Article 9 of the African Charter 
on Human and Peoples' Rights. Based on John Milton's arguments, 
freedom of speech is understood as a multi-faceted right that includes 
not only the right to express, or disseminate, information and ideas, 
but three further distinct aspects: 

THE RIGHT TO SEEK INFORMATION AND ***** IDEAS *****;
THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE INFORMATION AND ***** IDEAS *****;
THE RIGHT TO IMPART INFORMATION AND ***** IDEAS *****.

International, regional and national standards also recognize that 
freedom of speech, as the freedom of expression, includes any medium, be 
it orally, in written, in print, THROUGH THE INTERNET OR THROUGH ART 
FORMS.

THIS MEANS THAT THE PROTECTION OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH AS A RIGHT 
INCLUDES NOT ONLY THE CONTENT, BUT ALSO THE MEANS OF EXPRESSION.

Rabbit as Symbol: The Significance of Rabbits in Dreams and Art, by Sandy Koi.

"One of the most important archetypes is that of the Psychopomp. A Psychopomp is a god or goddess (energy form) that 
acts as a liaison, and guide, between the three worlds-the physical earthly level that we dwell upon, the Underworld and 
the Heavens. In classical mythology, the Roman God Mercury was a Psychopomp, for example.

HE GUIDED THE ANCIENT HEROES TO AND THROUGH THE UNDERWORLD,
AND HE ALSO BROUGHT MESSAGES FROM ABOVE TO THE MERE MORTALS HERE ON EARTH. 

Symbolically, Rabbit in the Underworld is therefore representative of USING ONE'S INTUITION: knowing how to get around 
"in the dark" and being comfortable traveling in "unmarked territory." By default, it can also denote having or 
DEVELOPING TRUST IN THE "INNER LIGHT."

RABBIT DOES NOT NEED AN OUTSIDE SOURCE TO ILLUMINATE HIS WAY.

His connection to the Collective Energy maintains his pathway.

They teach us Unconditional Love, and Compassion for Life, by virtue of eliciting those things within us.

And one important symbolical meaning that Rabbit should elicit in us is that of PLAYFULNESS AND JOY.
Their nonsense displays of happiness are part of the Dance of Life-which is nothing more than a Cosmic Binkie."
