ΚΕΦΑΛΗ ΚΓ 

SKIDOO 

What man is at ease in his Inn? 
GET OUT. 
Wide is the world and cold. 
GET OUT. 
Thou has become an in-itiate. 
GET OUT. 
But thou canst not get out by the way thou camest in. The Way out is THE WAY. 
GET OUT. 
For OUT is Love and Wisdom and Power.12 
GET OUT. 
If thou hast T already, first get UT.13 
Then get O. 
And so at last get OUT. 

COMMENTARY (ΚΓ) 

Both "23" and "Skidoo" are American words meaning "Get out". This chapter describes the Great Work under 
the figure of a man ridding himself of all his accidents. 

He first leaves the life of comfort; then the world at large; and, lastly, even the initiates. 

In the fourth section is shown that there is no return for one that has started on this path. 

The word OUT is then analysed, and treated as a noun. 

Besides the explanation in the note, O is the Yoni; T, the Lingam; and U, the Hierophant; the 5th card 
of the Tarot, the Pentagram. It is thus practically identical with IAO. 

The rest of the chapter is clear, from the note. 

NOTES 

(12) O = , "The Devil of the Sabbath". U = 8, the Hierophant or Redeemer. T = Strength, the Lion. 

(13) T, manhood, the sign of the cross or phallus. UT, the Holy Guardian Angel; UT, the first syllable 
of Udgita, see the Upanishads. O, Nothing or Nuit.

SHOUT-OUTS to anons @ http://www.whatis-theplan.org/t1676-project-mayhem-2012 for solving the first 
hidden Enigma.*

Next Enigma. 

Question: What's the cipher that is not a cypher? 

The first clue is a meta-clue. 

THE BATTLE OF THE ANTS That is not which is. The only Word is Silence. The only Meaning of that Word is 
NOT. Thoughts are FALSE. Fatherhood is unity disguised as duality. Peace implies WAR. Power implies WAR. 
Harmony implies WAR. Victory implies WAR. Glory implies WAR. Foundation implies WAR. Alas! for the 
Kingdom wherein all these are at WAR.

Plot 

In 1980s Germany at the height of the Cold War, 19-year-old Karl Koch (August Diehl) finds the world 
around him threatening and chaotic. Inspired by the fictitious character Hagbard Celine (from Robert 
Anton Wilson and Robert Shea's Illuminatus! Trilogy), he starts investigating the backgrounds of 
political and economic power and discovers signs that make him believe in a worldwide conspiracy. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23_(film) 

Karl Werner Lothar Koch (July 22, 1965 – ca. May 23, 1989) was a German hacker in the 1980s, who 
called himself "hagbard", after Hagbard Celine. He was involved in a Cold War computer espionage 
incident. 

Koch was born in Hanover. As his moniker would suggest, he was heavily influenced by The Illuminatus! 
Trilogy by Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea. Besides adopting his pseudonym from a character in the 
book, he also named his computer "FUCKUP" ("First Universal Cybernetic-Kinetic Ultra-Micro Programmer"), 
after a computer designed and built by that character. He was addicted to cocaine and became extremely 
paranoid, convinced he was fighting the Illuminati like his literary namesake. 

Koch was loosely affiliated with the CHAOS COMPUTER CLUB. He worked with the hackers known as DOB 
(Dirk-Otto Brezinski), Pengo (Hans Heinrich Hübner), and Urmel (Markus Hess), and was involved in 
selling hacked information from US military computers to the KGB. Eventually he and Pengo came forward 
and confessed to the authorities.

INTRODUCTION By Robert Anton Wilson, Ph.D. 

I happen to agree with Ernest Hemingway that, of all the requirements a writer needs, the most important 
is a built in, cast-iron, shock-proof bullshit-detector. A writer may have seen and felt a great deal; 
with extreme good luck, he may even have understood what he saw and felt; but without the tool Hemingway 
recommended, he will never communicate efficiently. 

This is especially true of writers on mysticism, who have produced more bad writing than any other 
single group on this planet, except for the politicians. 

Ezra Pound once commented that there are two types of clarity. The first is illustrated by the sentence, 
"Get me two pounds of four-inch nails."The second is illustrated by, "Get me the type of Rembrandt I 
like." Anybody can understand the first kind of clarity; the second is clear only when speaker and 
hearer share a mutual universe of sensibility; but both are equally LUCID under ideal conditions." 

"Aleister Crowley was, in my opinion, one of the most original and important thinkers of this era -- 
right up there with such titans as Einstein and Joyce. Indeed, what Einstein did for physics and Joyce 
for the novel (and Picasso for painting, and Pound for poetry, and Wright for architecture), Crowley did 
for the mystic tradition. He swept aside all 19th Century barnacles and incrustations, redefined every 
concept, and created something that is totally contemporary with our existence as 20th Century persons." 

Crowley was always eccentric, often outrageous on principle, and sometimes downright vicious, but HE IS 
*** UNIQUE AMONG THE ILLUMINATI *** in not trying to conceal such traits but, rather, in making every 
possible effort to ensure that disciples would never be able to sentimentally sanctify him. 

"I have no doubt that Crowley got outside the normal constrictions of ego -- way outside -- many, many 
times. I accept the reports in his diaries that he learned to achieve dhyana (the trance of unity) 
fairly regularly and easily, and occasionally got beyond even that to Samadhi (THE STATE, KNOWN ONLY TO 
ADVANCED ORIENTAL ADEPTS AND STUDENTS OF *** QUANTUM PHYSICS ***, WHERE IT MAKES SENSE TO SAY THAT *** 
EXISTENCE AND NON-EXISTENCE ARE THE SAME. ***)" 

"I refer to a verse in THE BOOK OF LIES (*** FALSELY SO CALLED ***), Chapter 70, paragraph 6,
"But FRATER PERDURABO is nothing but an EYE; what eye none knoweth." Frater Perdurabo is
Crowley himself, or at least the Crowley who wrote The Book ollies. But what eye?
Crowley's official commentary is unhelpful: "Paragraph 6 states a fact unsuited to the grade of any
reader of this book."
