Chaos Out of Order:
The Rise and Fall of the Swedenborgian Rite
By Bro. R. A. Gilbert [14 September 1995]
SWEDENBORG: THE MAN AND HIS WORK
http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/aqc/swedenborg.html

Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772) was a Swedish philosopher and scientist 
who, at 56, had a spiritual awakening and wrote numerous books on his 
theological views and related topics. He advocated a version of 
Christianity where works count as much as faith, with the trinity 
existing in Jesus, instead of three separate entities. Swedenborg 
derived inspiration from dreams and visions, and claimed to be able to 
visit heaven and hell at will. His works were widely read after his 
death and highly regarded by poets, writers and mystics such as Blake, 
Baudelaire, Strindberg, Balzac, Yeats, Jung, and William James.
