Imagine we sow the world with seeds.

Imagine we finally find the COURAGE needed.
to BECOME THE CHANGE WE WISH TO SEE in the World.

Imagine we are no longer afraid of Fear.
Imagine we re invent and reverse Reality.

Imagine the corrupt start to Fear Us.
Imagine corrupt Banksters start to Fear Us.
Imagine corrupt Governments start to Fear Us.
Imagine corrupt Corporations start to Fear Us.

Imagine we conquer Freedom by beginning to be Free.
Imagine we conquer Justice by beginning to do Fair.
Imagine we conquer Truth by beginning to do and be True to ourselves.

Imagine Information equals Power.
Imagine we start a Fight Club.
Imagine the System is built upon lies.

Imagine we purchase a USB drive.
Imagine we take it to our workplaces.
Imagine we pretend we have to work late hours.
Imagine we accumulate all sort of evidences about illegal deeds.
Imagine Conscientious insiders worldwide begin to expose all lies.

Imagine we code an extremely simple interface so that anyone can do it.
Imagine we all synchronize our clocks to act at the same Time, on the Winter solstice, The 21st of December 2012 at 11 minutes past 11 local time.

SEED TREE

Seed trees are trees left after reproduction cutting to provide seeds for natural regeneration in the seed-tree method.

These trees serve as both THE GENE SOURCE FOR THE NEW CROP OF REGENERATION and AS A SOURCE OF TIMBER DURING FUTURE CUTTINGS.
Because of its importance, a seed tree should be carefully chosen based upon both economic and biological factors.

Selected seed trees should be the desired species, PHENOTYPICALLY SUPERIOR, PROLIFIC IN SEEDING AND FLOWERING, STURDY AND HEALTHY, FREE OF DAMAGE, AND OF GOOD GROWTH FORM.
After the site has been successfully regenerated, seed trees may be commercially harvested or the trees may be retained for visual enhancement and as backup against catastrophic losses of regeneration due to agents such as fire or drought.
The presence of seed trees distinguishes the seed-tree method from clearcutting.

Many people consider the seed-tree method more aesthetically pleasing than clearcutting because SOME MATURE TREES ARE RETAINED ON THE SITE FOR AT LEAST UNTIL REGENERATION BECOMES WELL ESTABLISHED.

Mystical Seed trees are featured in The Legend of Zelda.

In The Legend of Zelda, occasionally called Legend of Zelda or simply Zelda, a high fantasy action-adventure video game series, The Mystical Seed Trees serve as warp destinations in both Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons. They can be found throughout Holodrum and Labrynna. Each tree is named for the type of Mystical Seed it bears. The types are Ember Seed Trees, Mystery Seed Trees, Scent Seed Trees, Gale Seed Trees, and Pegasus Seed Trees.
Link, the main protagonist in Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series, merely need to swipe at the seeds with his sword to harvest seeds from the tree.
He cannot obtain any seeds without having first acquired a Seed Satchel. Once harvested, a tree won't produce seeds for a while.
In Oracle of Ages, the majority of trees exist in the Past or Present, but not in both. In one case, Link gets to plant a Scent Seed Tree in the past on Crescent Island.

WARPING TO AND HARVESTING SEEDS FROM THIS TREE ONLY OCCURS IN THE PRESENT TIME PERIOD.
