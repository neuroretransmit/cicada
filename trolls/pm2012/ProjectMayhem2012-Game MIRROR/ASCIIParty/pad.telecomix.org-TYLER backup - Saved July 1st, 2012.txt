Remember : There won't be only ONE TYLER, but MANY #TYLERCANDIDATES.
BEE AWARE: it *IS* EXPECTED that @DHSgov, @DARPA, @CYBER, #NSA, #MOSSAD...and related 'side players', WILL release one or several subtly trojanized #TYLERCANDIDATES, for obvious reasons.
Obviously, the cipherhacking community will audit all and decide which one is the SIMPLEST and SAFEST.
Consider this the most challenging SUMMER OF CODE ever.

Plan :
- Before June 2012 : Dev' begining
-
-
- November 5th, 2012 : 

    All TYLER CANDIDATES get out of Beta version and their source code, network design diagrams & documentation MUST be released ANONYMOUSLY & into the Public Domain.

    This (=this Pad's) one is supposed to be just one TYLER CANDIDATE.

    The more TYLER CANDIDATES coded by different coders/groups in STEALTH mode, the better resilience the Project gets.

    Remember: a potential Conscientious Insider (CI) has to be able to trust TYLER with his life before deciding to leak sensitive data [through/with/to] it. Hence total transparency code wise is not just a desired feature: TRUST is the CORE of TYLER. Hence the motto: 'In TYLER we TRUST.'

    November 5th to December 11th: Code Audits. Cypherhacking community agrees on the safest & most TRUSTED #TYLER CANDIDATE.

    December 12th 11:11 UTC: The final TYLER version will be announced and released in the wild.

    December 12th onwards: 

"On the 10 days that go from 12-12-2012 to 12-21-2012, the World will see an
unprecedented amount of Corporate, Financial, Military and State leaks that
will have been secretly gathered by millions of CONSCIENTIOUS citizens, vigilants, 
whistleblowers and insiders worldwide, dormant cells of a global
'Fight Club' from all countries, patiently waiting for the time to SWARM 
the Egregor's Consciousness in perfect synchrony.
Once TYLER be on the wild and Truths be revealed:
   1. You DO ask questions.
   2. You DO ask questions. [Question: Why is the same statement here twice?] -Maybe this is an exception?
   3. No excuses. [You have no excuse for that!]
   4. No lies. [And that's the truth!] You are truthfully annoying
   5. You HAVE to trust TYLER: for YOU are the Watchmen." [Question: Who is tyler? Do you expect me to trust strangers now?]
   
- 12-21-2012 11:11: The End of Fear. [Doesn't the end of fear require change? Isn't change scary?]
Not all change is scary

    The Amnesic Incognito Live System (Tails):

"Tails is a live system that aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity. It helps you to use the Internet anonymously almost anywhere you go and on any computer but leave no trace using unless you ask it explicitly.
It is a complete operating-system designed to be used from a DVD or a USB stick independently of the computer's original operating system. It is Free Software and based on Debian GNU/Linux.
Tails comes with several built-in applications pre-configured with security in mind: web browser, instant messaging client, email client, office suite, image and sound editor. Tails relies on the Tor anonymity network to protect your privacy online: all software are configured to connect through Tor, and direct (non-anonymous) connections are blocked."

    OpenRelay 

OpenRelay is a p2p (peer to peer) based web hosting solution. OpenRelay  is free (as in freedom), which means it is currently licensed under the  GNU GPLv3. The goal of OpenRelay is to decentralize hosting, create an alternative  to paid hosts, and to allow anyone (with a few friends) to be able to  host a site.  OpenRelay builds upon the BitTorrent Protocol developed by Bram Cohen,  as well as other projects like Twitter's Bootstrap, Werzeug, Django,  Python-gnupg, PyCrypto, and AutonomoTorrent.

    Freehaven (MIT):

"The Free Haven Project aims to deploy a system for distributed data storage robust against attempts by powerful adversaries to find and destroy stored data. Free Haven uses a secure mixnet for communication, and it emphasizes distributed, reliable, and anonymous storage over efficient retrieval. Some of the problems Free Haven addresses include providing sufficient accountability without sacrificing anonymity, building trust between servers based entirely on their observed behavior, and providing user interfaces that will make the system easy for end-users.

    TELEX:

"Telex is a new approach to circumventing Internet censorship that is  intended to help citizens of repressive governments freely access online  services and information.  The main idea behind Telex is to place  anticensorship technology into the Internet's core network  infrastructure, through cooperation from large ISPs.  Telex is markedly  different from past anticensorship systems, making it easy to distribute  and very difficult to detect and block."

What :
TYLER is described as a:
"Massively Distributed Uncensorable & Collaborative Wiki-P2P Cipherspace Structure"
Reference: http://pastebin.com/Wt15GXTn
Why :

    "[Any leaking platform dependant of easyly identifiable human beings] puts the role of the Editor in great personal danger and in risk of being 'totally incapacitated' —CIA's term to refer to Daniel Ellsberg— by potential enemies while it dramatically slows down the

release process.
 

    By its own nature, WikiLeaks mirror servers are limited in numbers, and

very much resource-hungry during media peaks. 
 
    Being limited in numbers means that they are prone to attack, DDoS, 
    international IP bans, governmental inclusion in blacklists... etc. etc.
    These are single point of failure that threaten the infrastructure of the
    whole system.
 
TYLER aims to circumvent these issues."

    To help Mr. Obama to fulfill his promises and to make them extensible to the whole of society. World. Wide.

The Obama-Biden Ethics Plan, November 2008 read like this:
____________________________________________________________________
 
Protect Whistleblowers:
 
"Often the best source of information about waste, fraud, and abuse in 
government is an existing government employee committed to public 
integrity and willing to speak out. Such acts of courage and patriotism, 
which can sometimes save lives and often save taxpayer dollars, SHOULD 
BE ENCOURAGED rather than stifled. We need to empower federal employees 
as watchdogs of wrongdoing and partners in performance.
Barack Obama will strengthen whistleblower laws to protect federal workers who expose waste, fraud, and abuse of authority in government. Obama will ensure 
that federal agencies expedite the process for reviewing whistleblower 
claims and whistleblowers have full access to courts and due process."

How[Principles] : 
--> We have to propose some constant "laws" for TYLER :
    - EVERYONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEND data throught the network
    - EVERYONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO READ data throught the network
    - ALL data SHOULD BE sent ANONYMOUSLY
    - ALL data SHOULD BE read ANONYMOUSLY
    - ALL data MUST pass an ETHICAL CODE VALIDATION by a majority (3 out of 5 OR 4/7 OR 5/9 OR 6/11?) of positive KARMA JUDGES randomly chosen within those currently logged on and available within the HIVEMIND (=random, distributed & temporary TRUST 'AUTHORITY', hence no risk of being abused by 'permanent' powers, hence the "Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely" common to hierarchies is successfully solved.)
    - ALL data sent SHOULD BE stored somewhere in the network, even if no verification was procedeed.
    - ALL data belongs to everyone/nobody after sending
    - ALL trusted/accepted data* SHOULD PERSIST in the network, even if a people of a small group of people wants to delete it.
    -  ALL trusted/accepted data* SHOULD BE EASILY REACHABLE, using keywords, a public key / Secure Hash Algorithm / Magnet URI scheme.
    -  ALL trusted/accepted data* SHOULD BE EASILY CONTEXTUALIZED within a distributed Wiki that mimics Wikipedia structure. i.e.: [TYLER]/wiki/Company_Name

    KISS Principle: Keep It Simple, Stupid!

"We need to design an USER-FRIENDLY software, so with a really simple interface that anyone non-computer-savvy can use and which works on all operating systems (including Android, ou  iOS)."
See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle

    Main goals for TYLER: SIMPLICITY, SAFETY & TRUST.

A Conscentious insider has to be able to trust TYLER with his life before deciding to use it to leak their sensitive information on corruption and illegal deeds. 
    If a choice between Anonymity & speed has to be made, speed will always come second.
    TYLER is also described as an "EXTREMELY SIMPLE interface, so that anyone can do it."
A Conscentious insider has to be able to trust TYLER with his life before deciding to use it to leak their sensitive information on corruption and illegal deeds. +2

    Kerckhoffs's principle:

In cryptography, Kerckhoffs's principle (also called Kerckhoffs's Desiderata, Kerckhoffs's assumption, axiom, or law) was stated by Auguste Kerckhoffs in the 19th century:
A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.
Kerckhoffs's principle was reformulated (perhaps independently) by Claude Shannon as:
"The enemy knows the system." 
In that form, it is called Shannon's maxim. In contrast to "security through obscurity," it is widely embraced by cryptographers.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle
ERRORISM is fine: Goal is not "perfection" but to MOVE UPWARDS the spiral.
"To avoid stalling, we won't aim at 'perfection': errors happen...Everything is OK!
 
'Almost good enough' might be MORE than a 'good enough' mentality. Less Syntactics, More Semantics.
 
'Evolutionary Computing', 'Adaptative Thinking', 'Dynamically Adhocratic' and 'Mutating problem solving' are key elements here.
 
We don't aim to find the 'best'  solution, as there might be infinite ways to achieve a single goal: we  aim to MOVE UPWARDS the spiral. 
 
Or, in Herman Hesse's words:
 
"We have learned a lot, Siddhartha, there is still much to learn. We are  not going around in circles, we are moving UP, the circle is a SPIRAL,  we have already ascended many a level."

How[Technical] :
- How to ensure that a content is not a bullshit ?+2
Coding a crowdsourced & karma based "TRUST AUTHORITY" into TYLER's HiveMind.
The users that the HiveMind TRUSTS the most will be those whom be awarded with the most karma. Karma = TRUST.
How do you earn good Karma?

    By proving that you are a Conscientious Insider (CI). 

    - How?
        - By providing semantical authentication: 
        
        "publish some kind of internal info that only people who might have actually worked in that Company might know, in order to semantically AUTHENTICATE you towards fellow leakers and colleagues.
        
        "Then other workers would know that you have actually been there, so  your level of TRUST for anything you might have to say about the company  would be thumbed up by the very internal people to that company.  External people to that company could thumb you up or down, but that  wouldn't mean much, for their votes would have much less weight, unless  they can prove they have actually worked there by providing a NEW type  of environmental/semantical information."
        "the  users with the highest karma, as they have proved to be reliable, might  have more weight in the system, towards thumbing up or down other users"
        
        "The karma based "Trust Authority" should be based in "epistemic  reliability". That is to say: any leak would pass the filter and be  published by default. Yet, there would be an internal karma based  ranking for each WikiTYLER contributor that would allow anybody  completely foreign to that Company to quickly sort out the leaks based  on the "trustability" karma.
A leaker would not only provide the internal evidence on  corruption/fraud but would it would be upon them to also disclose if  they worked there, for how long and so on. They could also provide  information regarding the physical environment / the servers rooms and  so on, so that other Conscentious leakers can spot that information and  verify it as TRUSTED. They would get, say 100 karma points for each  member in the Hivemind that trusts them.
This could be abused by bots / Artificial Intelligence agents / etc., of  course. DARPA has been heavyly busy building "social armies". Google  their project called "Social Media in Strategic Communication (SMISC)".

http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks
More brainstorming here: a possible solution might be to issue  semantical challenge-response queries in the way of CREATIVE tasks, in a  peer-to-peer way. In other words:
TYLER might include a Hivemind of "validators" that challenge potential leakers to pass
a quick Turing test. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test
 A candidate leaker might  have to solve a certain creative task in order to tell them from a  machine. Say, compose a two line poem with the words "lurk" "evolve" and "countdown". Machines cannot understand/solve that. Humans do."
 Also: CAPTCHAS challenges can be maliciously proxied to other humans, (i.e.: setup a free image hosting and use the humans that use it to upload images to solve CAPTCHAS that TYLER might present to potential leakers. Hence we MUST NOT trust them to be able to tell the difference between a human and an AI.
 Challenges can be CONTEXT based ((= compose a surrealist poem about Fight Club with the words "lurk" "evolve" and "countdown", tell me a joke about TYLER or draw a simple picture of a lion, etc., so that they cannot be meaningfully (=semantically meaningful, context wise) proxied to other humans. Obviously the goal is not that the poem be aesthetically beautiful but that a human can judge that it was actually CREATED by another human. (== #DARE2KREATE)

Reddit-like importance rating?
    > The system could choose 5 "judges" randomly:
        - Step 1 : A judge receive a query (give query to another if no decision within amount of time?). "Wants to be judge for this doc ?"
            - Yes (Goto Step 2)
            - No, or timeout (Another judge is choosen randomly)
        - Step 2: Chosen person judges the document, YES/NO
            - Yes (If 3/5 judges say YES, go to step 3A)
            - No (If 3/5 judges say NO, go to step 3B)
        - Step 3:
            - 3A:
                Majority of judges voted yes. Document is accepted, now general users can vote YES or NO in case judges were wrong. Enough negative votes (~100?) remove the document from the main list.
            - 3B:
                Document is rejected, placed into pile of rejected docs. General users can vote YES or NO in case judges were wrong. Enough positive votes (~100?) make it accepted to the main list. --> Good solution if malicious people suceeds to reject a good document in the rejected list.

Yes. 
With much power comes much responsibility.

- What should be TYLER's ETHICAL CODE?
To respect citizens PRIVACY by rejecting to publish information that invades the privacy of individuals.
"Privacy protects us from abuses by those in power, even if we're doing nothing wrong at the time of surveillance." Bruce Schneier

        May be there should be some sort of sub-system that is run by m0ds where people with leaks can request an invite code where they can input to upload
        WE DON'T WANT SHITTY/NON-VALID LEAKS, the fuck is the point of that?
        
        Not trying to create a difference in power or anything, but it is important that the leaks are legitimate. Maybe some sort of proof/logs of the origin of the leaks? Only trusted members should be mods, this system can and will fail if we do not choose wisely.-1
    Something else to consider: who gets to be a mod? What if mods become corrupt? Non-mods moderate the mods in that case?-1
         Nobody should get to be a mod but, at much, a temporary jury.
         
         Reason: in order to minimize abuses by 'Power', we shouldn't rely on  'permanent mods' or in 'trusted members', for, as someone has rightly  pointed out, Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. 
        A nice way to minimize 'corruption by power' would be by making that power/authority temporary.  I.e.: to issue a temporary ticket/token to a random set of validated  humans to act as a temporary jury whose limited mission is to  temporarily approve that a certain leak submission passes TYLER's  Ethical Code, in order to flag it accordingly.+2
    What happens if leaks cannot be traced to proof? For example, no photo/video/audio/transcribed docs to indicate legitimacy.
    That would be fine, yet, that would be flagged in the leak entry, and that would be reflected in a kind of karma for the corresponding TRUST for each leak, according to the validations of the HiveMind.
How [Dev]
Laws : 
    - Portable (should work without system install)
    - Lightweight (30 MB MAX with potential plugins)-1
    30 Mb might be too much. We should consider TYLER to fit steganographically hidden in a non suspicious JPG/PNG or an MP3 (see "Plausible deniability" below) that a potential leaker could either carry with her or download from the net (successfully bypassing all firewall security policies like this), and then unwrap it locally, execute it (inside a sandbox?) and then, once the leaks be uploaded, it would securely delete itself forever. If TYLER is going to be an "extremely simple interface" then it might be only a matter of coding a sort of universal wrapper + a Trust Authority + a distributed Wiki to sort all leaks. So, let's say, 500kb-1Mb MAX? <-- way too small, may not be possible.
    See discussion below.
    - For people without admin (Windows7) i suggest that a guest/normal should be able to use this. ie two points above this one, no sysinstall.
- ! Use I2P : http://www.i2p2.de/ (SAM seems good to easily open anonymous communcations, so I can create/adapt a C/C++ library for V3)
i2p , i think we on t expect I2p
- ? Use Tahoe-LAFS for more large files (video/audio) : https://tahoe-lafs.org
    --> But need to preserve anonymity (when i2p is used as the transport layer with tahoe-lafs that solves it more or less [i2p+tahoe exists and is implemented, and deployed]) --> Interesting
http://killyourtv.i2p/tahoe-lafs/  (currently have about 20 nodes inside i2p would be nice to see tyler use it and / or syndie too, see below)
[disagree] Tahoe-LAFS is only anonymous when combined with i2p. Why not just use i2p if we want this?
See also : Syndie -> http://syndie.i2p2.de/
- Or ... from scratch ? --> IMO it's better to unify what is existing already with "application layer glue" instead of reinventing cryptographic transports and fragmenting cypherspace further. That would be the case if we use Tor/I2P/Freenet APIs <--- syndie does that for us (or rather it attempts to do so)
Maybe a TOR/i2p network that forces the leaker's ip to be hidden/spoofed. No one should know where the leak came from, only whether it is a real leak of not.

Communications:
If a potential leaker inside a protected & firewalled network cannot carry in or out of the company a USB key, the leaker could try to upload it straight to TYLER from inside the company network. But the leaker might have difficulties bypassing firewalls/IDS security policies and so on. Even worse, if he tried to "test" communicating with TYLER, he might be setting off the alarms as a potential leaker about to leak.
There are several ways to bypass firewalls & IDS:
1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_channel
"a covert channel is a type of computer security attack that creates a capability to transfer information objects between processes that are not supposed to be allowed to communicate by the computer security policy. "
2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_channel
"A timing channel is one example of a covert channel for passing unauthorized information, in which one process signals information to another process by modulating its own use of system resources (e.g., central processing unit time) in such a way that this manipulation affects the real response time observed by the second process."
3. PUBLIC KEY STEGANOGRAPHY. This is a novel and extremely interesting approach. Basically, the client and TYLER negotiate a certain "code" (i.e.: I'm going to send you 11 ICMP packets: that means the firewall is not going to inspect unsuspiciously looking traffic. You only check one every three ICMPs for a certain flag, and we can build and arrange a certain binary code from there. Then we start communicating. (Just a simple example).
No IDS/Firewall can check for this. If implemented properly, this should be virtually undetectable: total stealth mode on.
For a very interesting approach on using Public Key Steganography, check TELEX, already cited above and now here too:

    TELEX:

"Telex  is a new approach to circumventing Internet censorship that is   intended to help citizens of repressive governments freely access  online  services and information.  The main idea behind Telex is to  place  anticensorship technology into the Internet's core network   infrastructure, through cooperation from large ISPs.  Telex is markedly   different from past anticensorship systems, making it easy to  distribute  and very difficult to detect and block."

 Possible "simple solution" for TYLER (following the OSI Model):
Piggyback Syndie
 (Application Layer) Tyler, the top layer UI, is in charge of being what the user sees and interacts with, user submits content via the UI and it gets passed to the Presentation Layer where it is packed and prepared for transport
 (Presnetation Layer) standardized format with cyptographic signatures, checksums etc used to package content, implementation details, format is not important YET, must be a standardized format.
Details aren't important, but this layer is "our" layer, so the quality of Tyler will depend mainly on theses decisions.
 
 (Session Layer) no real need for one?
 (Transport Layer) syndie, it is by nature meant to be network agnostic, using the syndie protocol would take away from the hardships of implementing new transports, let syndie care about interfacing with tor, mixmaster, i2p etc.
 
 
tl;dr for yellow stuff:
decide on a common cryptographic format for messages and piggyback on syndie.
Tyler would be the UI that would package and unpackage data in a common cryptographic format that would be transported via syndie
--> Study Syndie : Someone has the source code ?
HOW TO GET SYNDIE SOURCE CODE :+1
 
Prerequistes : 
- Have I2P installed on your computer.
- Download "mtn" (Google it, or check-it with your Package management system : apt, pacman, etc)
- Start "mtn" tunnel on your pannel (http://127.0.0.1:7657/i2ptunnel/)
 
mtn is a CVS-like (like git and svn)
 
mtn -d i2p.mtn db init
mtn genkey <mail_or_fake>@mail.i2p
SYNDIE source code is on I2P mtn repo :
With I2P installed (and mtn relay activated) :
mtn -d i2p.mtn pull 127.0.0.1:8998 i2p.syndie
mtn -d i2p.mtn co --branch=i2p.syndie
Data format :
(ideas) We can distinguish two data formats :
    - Plain text/html (light) 
    - Binary files (pdf, videos, audio, etc)
    
    - Use PGP signed and encrypted file that can be mounted locally as a file system (TrueCrypt+GPG?) <-- sounds like redundant encryption, multilayer maybe but in the end you'd need to figure out a way to package the keys for multilayer crypto.
    
      I.E. vfat partition as a file that was encrypted by gpg. 
    - Possible problem: cross platform compatibility, (need a good filesystem that every OS can mount. maybe FAT32 since things will not be too large and message size will be an issue due to using transport layers that are slow)
    
    rProxy might be useful aswell
    
    Features of RProxy:
    

    HTTP pipe-lining to reduce connection overhead to a downstream (this reduces latency of a full handshake per-request to a downstream)

    Easily take downstream servers out of rotation.

    Various methods of load-balancing client-requests to a downstream.

    Full SSL support: 

    TLS False start

    x509 verification

    Certificate caching

    Session caching

    All other commonly used SSL options

    Transparent URI rewriting.

    Various X-Header configurations including options for added extended TLS fields.

    Upstream and downstream thresholding (to reduce memory for slow/blocking downstream connections)

    Per-downstream backlog, and backlog timeout management.

    Flexible logging configuration.

    Optional memory optimizations on systems which support mallopt()

    Very low memory usage with optimal configuration.

    It’s really @#$@#$r* fast.

Talk to TYLER when you have an idea so dangerous you can't share it with anyone else
Register TellTyler.com -5
Reason: TYLER doesn't need to depend upon any one site/person, specially not on any dotcom = certainly would be censored. "Distributed" means precisely that.
centralized = bad idea
SPECIFICATIONS :
Interesting eMule specs : http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/labs/danss/presentations/emule.pdf
(good thing to keep in mind with eMule is that they have it on i2p as well)
Use cases (ideas) :
Offline mode :
When an user wants to grab some data, he will launch TYLER from its USB key (ie), and he will choose files/folders to grab.
Files and folder will be locally stored in the USB key (ie), but encrypted by a user-defined password.
Files SHOULD never be unencrypted.
Online mode :
When TYLER is in online mode file sharing is enabled via P2P protocols (we have to abstract I2P/Tor/Freenet layers).
Files or chunks should also be encrypted during transfers.
Example with an I2P transport : 
- Local grabbed files/leaks are encrypted with the user password (in a local db)
- When file is sent to another peer, it will be decrypted using user password but immedialty reencrypted depending on the protocol (here, with I2P public key).
- When the receiver receive chunks/file he will decrypt it with peer public key (sender) a immediatly reencrypt it locally with his own password
Any user can choose to decrypt one or some local files with his own password, but I can be dangerous, and should be done only on HIS computer.
TYLER should provide user-friendly interfaces to decrypt files and display them in RAM (not on hard drive disk) for better security.
Proposed cryptogaphic container specs:
PGP signed (optionally encrypted) tar.xz archive with structure as follows:
   message/ -- contains the origional file(s) that are sent
   manafest.json -- manafest file, contains checksums and metadata(? maybe not needed ?)
   reply/ -- holds the pgp signature of each file that is "agreed with"
   comments/ -- holds general comments of the origonal files
   
how it could work:
   ~ files can be targeted  to a specific set of users if needed
   ~ to post a tyler message you post in the given format on the syndie network or any other network.
   ~ public key identities can be tallied and tracked, a leaderboard of "identity newness" can be established to keep track of karma.
   ~ any user can compute the current karma of a user given that all the posts are still archived.
   ~ to +1 a post you'd replay the message and append a pgp signature of each file in the original message that you agree with in the reply folder of the new archive
   
it now looks more like automating a cryptogarphic format with a gui. basically a gpg wrapper using anonymity networks (just like it should be done). It could be done in bourne shell at this point. +1+1
It is good that this be the case, for this way it can benefit from years-long tested projects and technologies such as I2P, Tor, GPG, etc. Actually most of the really delicate work security wise (=cryptography implementation) has been developed already.
If we want TYLER to be an "extremely simple interface" then it might be only a matter of coding a sort of universal wrapper + a Trust Authority + a distributed Wiki to sort all leaks.
This has the added benefit that it could potentially be extremely lightweight. Not only it could fit in a USB key: our goal SHOULD be that it could EVEN fit steganographically hidden inside a non suspicious PNG/JPG image or inside an MP3 that a potential Conscientious Insider (CI) might either carry with her or download from any non-suspicious hosting site and then unwrap locally, execute (inside a sandbox, so that it be untraceable?), leak data and then securely delete forever.+9001
Plausible deniability
i.e.:
"In cryptography and steganography, deniable encryption is encryption that allows its users to convincingly deny  that some specific encrypted data exists, that a given piece of data is  encrypted, or that they are able to decrypt a given piece of encrypted  data[citation needed].  Such denials may or may not be genuine. For example, although  suspicions might exist that the data is encrypted, it may be impossible  to prove it without the cooperation of the users. If the data is  encrypted, the users genuinely may not be able to decrypt it. Deniable  encryption serves to undermine an attacker's confidence either that data  is encrypted, or that the person in possession of it can decrypt it and  provide the associated plaintext.
Normally ciphertexts decrypt to a single plaintext and hence once  decrypted, the encryption user cannot claim that he encrypted a  different message. Deniable encryption allows its users to decrypt the  ciphertext to produce a different (innocuous but plausible) plaintext  and insist that it is what they encrypted. The holder of the ciphertext  will not have the means to differentiate between the true plaintext, and  the bogus-claim plaintext."

What about using and adapting OpenPuff steganography tool
http://embeddedsw.net/OpenPuff_Steganography_Home.html
Supported formats : Images, audios, videos, flash, adobe.
Layers of security : Data, before carrier injection, is encrypted (1), scrambled (2), whitened (3) and encoded (4).
Layer 1 - Modern multi-cryptography : A set of 16 modern 256bit  open-source cryptography algorithms (chosen from AES Process  [1997-2000], NESSIE Process [2000-2003] and CRYPTREC Process  [2000-2003]) has been joined into a doublepassword multi-cryptography  algorithm (256bit+256bit) : AES / Anubis / Camellia / Cast-256 / Clefia /  FROG / Hierocrypt3 / Idea-NXT / MARS / RC6 / Safer+ / SC2000 / Serpent /  Speed / Twofish / Unicorn-A
Layer 2 - CSPRNG based scrambling : Encrypted data is always  scrambled to break any remaining stream pattern. A new cryptographically  secure pseudo random number generator (CSPRNG) is seeded with a third  password (256bit) and data is globally shuffled with random indexes.
Layer 3 - CSPRNG based whitening : Scrambled data is always mixed  with a high amount of noise, taken from an independent CSPRNG seeded  with hardware entropy.
Layer 4 - Adaptive non-linear encoding : Whitened data is always  encoded using a non-linear function that takes also original carrier  bits as input. Modified carriers will need much less change and deceive  many steganalysis tests (e.g.: chi square test).

Syndie route: 
PGP Signed archives -> distributed wiki (how)? [disagree] Freenet already does this with hg. We don't need another distributed wiki. Then what IS Tyler if not a distributed wiki? I assumed that is what is being worked on, as that is what is being advertised.
IDEA 1: TYLER as an anonymous DVCS
Possible suggestions:
~ patch files for text ( could mean that tyler could be used to do more than just a wiki it could be a dvcs that holds a wiki)
~ placing media could be done via inline/included base64 datablobs (could include encryption but that would be client side)
[disagree] Freenet already lets you use hg and insert into the network
IDEA:
- We need a way to stop trolls from trolling the pads.
Time tested interwebz way of dealing with trolls: IGNORE & focus.
Keep local copies of the Pad, rebuild and keep going with 108% commitment, STEALTH mode on. http://i.imgur.com/PT2b3.jpg +1+1
"No Fear. No distractions.
The ability to let that which does not matter truly slide."
