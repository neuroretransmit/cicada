# Fibonacci Primes Twitter

There is another unused Twitter profile associated with one of the emails Cicada used [@99194853094755497](https://twitter.com/991948530947554). This is around the 2014 puzzle timeline and has a single post of Fibonacci primes. The profile image and bio both have 9901 in them. There is nothing special in the profile image.
