2014 Jan 06 12:12 * Now talking in #cicadaops
2014 Jan 06 12:14 <Ymgve> this: BEGIN COMPRESSED RSA ENCRYPTED MESSAGE
2014 Jan 06 12:14 <Ymgve> is weird
2014 Jan 06 12:15 <Surtri> ?
2014 Jan 06 12:15 <Ymgve> because http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/The_Triangle_Puzzle is one of the few places google has seen it
2014 Jan 06 12:15 <shadowwalker> ?
2014 Jan 06 12:15 <shadowwalker> Why is that weird?
2014 Jan 06 12:15 <shadowwalker> Wot
2014 Jan 06 12:16 <PersonalKilljoy> they just added that
2014 Jan 06 12:16 <PersonalKilljoy> RSA perl module seems normal
2014 Jan 06 12:16 <grazzaB> huh
2014 Jan 06 12:16 <PersonalKilljoy> they added this line imho
2014 Jan 06 12:17 <grazzaB> but theres nothing else it could be
2014 Jan 06 12:17 <grazzaB> other than telling us its an rsa msg
2014 Jan 06 12:18 <Ymgve> so are any of you hard at work factoring n now?
2014 Jan 06 12:19 <grazzaB> im looking at image dimenisons
2014 Jan 06 12:19 <VBFH> hard waiting
2014 Jan 06 12:19 <Surtri> L0J1K is factoring
2014 Jan 06 12:19 <grazzaB> but i dont think its enough
2014 Jan 06 12:19 <Surtri> idk why he's not here
2014 Jan 06 12:19 <Surtri> and so is someone with 4 titans apparently
2014 Jan 06 12:19 <grazzaB> last i heard from him, he was only using 2 of them for this
2014 Jan 06 12:19 <Ymgve> so that is basically covered
2014 Jan 06 12:19 <Surtri> ya 2
2014 Jan 06 12:19 <VBFH> I'm trying with my quadcore, but against 4 titans, lel
2014 Jan 06 12:19 <Surtri> He had issues with 4
2014 Jan 06 12:20 <shadowwalker> L0j1k's factoring, as is a guy with four titans

2014 Jan 06 12:23 <absence_> masso, did u need something done?
2014 Jan 06 12:24 <Surtri> I suck at gimp
2014 Jan 06 12:24 <Surtri> I can do basic shit
2014 Jan 06 12:24 <Surtri> I've never been into gimp
2014 Jan 06 12:24 <PersonalKilljoy> ^
2014 Jan 06 12:24 <masso> just 2 eyes more
2014 Jan 06 12:24 <masso> or mmore
2014 Jan 06 12:24 <masso> someone open the pic
2014 Jan 06 12:24 <L0j1k> oi
2014 Jan 06 12:24 <Surtri> ok
2014 Jan 06 12:24 <L0j1k> personalkilljoy wat u say?
2014 Jan 06 12:25 <masso> bottom left, between the 2pics
2014 Jan 06 12:25 <masso> there is a gap
2014 Jan 06 12:25 <Surtri> masOk
2014 Jan 06 12:25 <Surtri> looking
2014 Jan 06 12:25 <masso> rest of pic matches without any additional pixels
2014 Jan 06 12:25 <absence_> yes
2014 Jan 06 12:25 <absence_> there is
2014 Jan 06 12:25 <masso> http://prntscr.com/2gz523
2014 Jan 06 12:25 <VBFH> bottom right too
2014 Jan 06 12:25 <Surtri> Ya there is
2014 Jan 06 12:25 <VBFH> at the bottom
2014 Jan 06 12:25 <Surtri> on right
2014 Jan 06 12:25 <Surtri> its at bottom ya
2014 Jan 06 12:26 <VBFH> and lower pic is overlapping on the right
2014 Jan 06 12:26 <masso> idk if coincidence or not
2014 Jan 06 12:26 <masso> hard to say at 3301

2014 Jan 06 12:31 <PersonalKilljoy> brother: still have that portscanner from soulseekah?
2014 Jan 06 12:37 <Ymgve> btw anyone got perl and the referenced module installed?
2014 Jan 06 12:37 <PersonalKilljoy> i probably have
2014 Jan 06 12:37 <PersonalKilljoy> wanna play?
2014 Jan 06 12:37 <Ymgve> could be interesting to test a bit with your own keys so you are prepared when the factorization is ready
2014 Jan 06 12:40 <absence_> welcome back ymgve
2014 Jan 06 12:40 <Ymgve> hi
2014 Jan 06 12:40 <absence_> how have you been
2014 Jan 06 12:40 <Ymgve> impatient
2014 Jan 06 12:40 <Surtri> lol
2014 Jan 06 12:40 <Ymgve> bastard cicada never contacted me
2014 Jan 06 12:40 <Surtri> Hue
2014 Jan 06 12:40 <absence_> im trying to get them whereever they slip up
2014 Jan 06 12:40 <PersonalKilljoy> looks like i need to install rsa mod
2014 Jan 06 12:41 <VBFH> y
2014 Jan 06 12:41 <VBFH> oops
2014 Jan 06 12:41 <masso> has anybody compared the twitter profile pic with thw one from last year?
2014 Jan 06 12:41 <masso> still the same or did they change it?
2014 Jan 06 12:42 <Surtri> Do we have one from alst year to compare it to?
2014 Jan 06 12:42 <Surtri> It looks the same

2014 Jan 06 12:57 <PersonalKilljoy> but how is public key in rsa encoded?
2014 Jan 06 12:58 <shadowwalker> Euler's fucntion
2014 Jan 06 12:58 <PersonalKilljoy> since it's just a pair of n and e
2014 Jan 06 12:58 <shadowwalker> *function
2014 Jan 06 12:58 <PersonalKilljoy> base64?
2014 Jan 06 12:59 <Ymgve> PersonalKilljoy: I guess it's just straight into the function initialization in perl
2014 Jan 06 12:59 <PersonalKilljoy> that's the prob
2014 Jan 06 12:59 <PersonalKilljoy> he wants some odd kind of input
2014 Jan 06 12:59 <PersonalKilljoy> and i'm trying to check which now. i will try it with base64
2014 Jan 06 13:00 <Ymgve> do a $rsa->keygen() and check the format
2014 Jan 06 13:01 <Ymgve> pretty sure it's just a map with e,d,n or something
2014 Jan 06 13:01 <shadowwalker> I tried base64 PersonalKilljoy, it didn't work
2014 Jan 06 13:08 <VBFH> anyone tried that perl-script?
2014 Jan 06 13:09 <Surtri> base64 for what
2014 Jan 06 13:09 <Surtri> ?

2014 Jan 06 13:10 <PersonalKilljoy> i almost have it
2014 Jan 06 13:10 <PersonalKilljoy> i'm using 2 scripts atm
2014 Jan 06 13:10 <PersonalKilljoy> one for key, second for encryption
2014 Jan 06 13:11 <VBFH> >bookface: maybe at this point all the fake puzzles are the real ones
2014 Jan 06 13:11 <PersonalKilljoy> public key (in PKCS1 format) is: -----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----

2014 Jan 06 13:13 <masso> Lurker69: pm
2014 Jan 06 13:15 <VBFH> anyone got this http://pastebin.com/NrDwJait working?
2014 Jan 06 13:16 <VBFH> I only get "Breached Armour."
2014 Jan 06 13:17 <Lurker69> VBFH: i remember that bug
2014 Jan 06 13:17 <Lurker69> it is some lame space somwhere

2014 Jan 06 13:20 <VBFH> ah, the formatting from pastebin is wrong
2014 Jan 06 13:20 <Surtri> VBFH: THATS IT
2014 Jan 06 13:20 <Surtri> I WAS LOOKING FOR THAT
2014 Jan 06 13:20 <VBFH> you have to move the my $plaintext and the message to the beginning of the line
2014 Jan 06 13:20 <PersonalKilljoy> works now
2014 Jan 06 13:20 <PersonalKilljoy> but
2014 Jan 06 13:21 <VBFH> "the game"
2014 Jan 06 13:21 <Lurker69> VBFH: yes
2014 Jan 06 13:21 <Lurker69> triagnel puzzle
2014 Jan 06 13:22 <PersonalKilljoy> but
2014 Jan 06 13:23 <PersonalKilljoy> im not sure if thats right module
2014 Jan 06 13:23 <PersonalKilljoy> see, we are using Crypto::RSA
2014 Jan 06 13:23 <VBFH> so?
2014 Jan 06 13:24 <PersonalKilljoy> my $rsa = new Crypt::RSA::ES::OAEP;
2014 Jan 06 13:24 <PersonalKilljoy> that's the right module
2014 Jan 06 13:24 <VBFH> Scheme: Crypt::RSA::ES::OAEP
2014 Jan 06 13:24 <VBFH> I think that is used to get the right thing
2014 Jan 06 13:25 <VBFH> that's the explicite scheme, the overal module is ::RSA
2014 Jan 06 13:26 <PersonalKilljoy> yea
2014 Jan 06 13:26 <PersonalKilljoy> how did you format it so well?
2014 Jan 06 13:26 <PersonalKilljoy> and under what encoding??
2014 Jan 06 13:27 <VBFH> try like this http://prntscr.com/2gzh7j
2014 Jan 06 13:27 <PersonalKilljoy> nah, i mean how did you formatted encrypted ct?
2014 Jan 06 13:27 <PersonalKilljoy> since this module has some weird encoding
2014 Jan 06 13:28 <VBFH> sorry, don't know what you mean
2014 Jan 06 13:29 <PersonalKilljoy> when you encrypt() it returns string
2014 Jan 06 13:29 <PersonalKilljoy> but i am wondering how do you make it to create more fancy output like the one you have in the script
2014 Jan 06 13:30 <PersonalKilljoy> when i used Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA it created nice output in PKCS
2014 Jan 06 13:30 <VBFH> I didn't write the script, If you think that
2014 Jan 06 13:30 <PersonalKilljoy> o ok, that's what i am asking for
2014 Jan 06 13:32 <Ymgve> btw, the trick to exposing the parameters is using $private->serialize()
2014 Jan 06 13:32 <Ymgve> the resulting output can be used to generate a private key object
2014 Jan 06 13:33 <Lurker69> VBFH: how did you find that pasteebin http://pastebin.com/NrDwJait ?
2014 Jan 06 13:33 <Lurker69> also fo me it woks out of the box
2014 Jan 06 13:33 <VBFH> it's on the wikia
2014 Jan 06 13:33 <Lurker69> a ok, i think i made it while solving triangle
2014 Jan 06 13:34 <Lurker69> if i copy text from bottom, raw txt vidow it works
2014 Jan 06 13:34 <VBFH> ah, right
2014 Jan 06 13:36 <Lurker69> also shall i put this in wikia
2014 Jan 06 13:36 <marcusw> masso: wat
2014 Jan 06 13:36 <Lurker69> or let noobs to not find it
2014 Jan 06 13:36 <Lurker69> let them get  p and q first
2014 Jan 06 13:36 <VBFH> put it after we got the primes
2014 Jan 06 13:36 <VBFH> yeah
2014 Jan 06 13:36 <PersonalKilljoy> Ymgve: i couldn't make it to works with serialize nor with deserialize
2014 Jan 06 13:37 <Lurker69> and after they wil figure out they dont know what to do with it then we can post that script
2014 Jan 06 13:37 <Lurker69> ohi marcusw
2014 Jan 06 13:37 <masso> marcusw: wat wat?+

2014 Jan 06 13:43 <Lurker69> ˇ^^^^^^not cicad 3301 2014
2014 Jan 06 13:43 <VBFH> p and q are enough
2014 Jan 06 13:44 <Ymgve> VBFH: well not 100%, you need either e or d in addition, since as far as I understand a p and q pair can give many different d/e pairs
2014 Jan 06 13:44 <Lurker69> btw... who knows how to create pblic key from n?
2014 Jan 06 13:44 <Ymgve> but e is usually (and also in this case) 65537
2014 Jan 06 13:44 <VBFH> yeah, in this case we just need p and q
2014 Jan 06 13:44 <VBFH> as 2012
2014 Jan 06 13:45 <Lurker69> http://nosuchlabs.com/ on this page we can test it for common primes

2014 Jan 06 13:48 <Lurker69> i nver understood why they chose those numbers
2014 Jan 06 13:48 <Ymgve> because in binary they have like two 1-bits
2014 Jan 06 13:48 <Ymgve> which means you can do fast calculations with them

2014 Jan 06 13:58 <Surtri> thats a chan
2014 Jan 06 13:58 <PersonalKilljoy> no idea
2014 Jan 06 13:58 <PersonalKilljoy> jsut made it up
2014 Jan 06 13:58 <Surtri> lol

2014 Jan 06 13:59 <PersonalKilljoy> ikr
2014 Jan 06 13:59 <Ymgve> so anyone got estimates how long it might take to factor n

2014 Jan 06 14:01 <Surtri> Can anyone help that?
2014 Jan 06 14:01 <Surtri> idk
2014 Jan 06 14:01 <Surtri> what to do
2014 Jan 06 14:01 <PersonalKilljoy> atm i am sieving for pali primes
2014 Jan 06 14:02 <PersonalKilljoy> where is this error from?
2014 Jan 06 14:02 <Surtri> from the script
2014 Jan 06 14:03 <PersonalKilljoy> which?

2014 Jan 06 14:03 <Surtri> That
2014 Jan 06 14:03 <VBFH> I got that error too, but then continued

2014 Jan 06 14:04 <Surtri> I don't use that script
2014 Jan 06 14:04 <Surtri> I cant
2014 Jan 06 14:04 <Surtri> it's dodmacadin who's getting the error
2014 Jan 06 14:04 <PersonalKilljoy> never used it
2014 Jan 06 14:04 <PersonalKilljoy> maybe some faster languages?

2014 Jan 06 14:06 <VBFH> there are 2 steps
2014 Jan 06 14:06 <VBFH> Polynomial Selection
2014 Jan 06 14:06 <VBFH> and then sieving
2014 Jan 06 14:06 <Surtri> sieving?
2014 Jan 06 14:07 <VBFH> ...do you even know what we're doing?
2014 Jan 06 14:07 <Surtri> Trying to factor I assume
2014 Jan 06 14:07 <Surtri> I've been occupied with something else, since I can't factor
2014 Jan 06 14:08 <VBFH> yes, and that's how to find the factors
2014 Jan 06 14:08 <masso> <Ymgve> so anyone got estimates how long it might take to factor n
2014 Jan 06 14:08 <masso> my opinion?
2014 Jan 06 14:08 <masso> or better my theory?
2014 Jan 06 14:08 <PersonalKilljoy> tell us
2014 Jan 06 14:09 <masso> I'm still convinced there is a hint within the pic
2014 Jan 06 14:09 * shadowwalker is now known as shadowbusy
2014 Jan 06 14:10 <masso> pic is 1.327px × 1.427px
2014 Jan 06 14:10 <masso> now call me stupid but
2014 Jan 06 14:10 <shadowbusy> masso you're the last person I would call stupid
2014 Jan 06 14:11 <masso> what about taking the square root of the number and start looking for the next primes from that?
2014 Jan 06 14:12 <masso> because the pic is in that ratio too
2014 Jan 06 14:13 <masso> ie. next prime larger than sqrt X next prime smaller than sqrt.
2014 Jan 06 14:14 <PersonalKilljoy> someone can check that
2014 Jan 06 14:14 <PersonalKilljoy> i will compute these palindromes
2014 Jan 06 14:14 <PersonalKilljoy> and then we can bacthgcd on that
2014 Jan 06 14:15 <masso> we'd need a database to search "next prime to a given number'
2014 Jan 06 14:15 <masso> found some online databases, but till now none with that function
2014 Jan 06 14:16 <masso> 86936255811994429165897273212462723167095682831951239080368528760.0794957480953741

2014 Jan 06 14:16 <shadowbusy> Hmm
2014 Jan 06 14:17 <shadowbusy> So wait what exactly are you trying to do?
2014 Jan 06 14:19 <PersonalKilljoy> funneh
2014 Jan 06 14:20 <masso> find the next higher and lower primes to the given number
2014 Jan 06 14:20 <PersonalKilljoy> 313 is pali prime
2014 Jan 06 14:20 <shadowbusy> masso: ok makes sense
2014 Jan 06 14:25 <masso> thing is, I have a bookmark to exactly a db like that in my browser...
2014 Jan 06 14:25 <masso> university of Kiev, Ukraine.
2014 Jan 06 14:25 <masso> and they seem to have other problems than running a database
2014 Jan 06 14:25 <PersonalKilljoy> radioactive primes
2014 Jan 06 14:26 <masso> no primes during civil war :(
2014 Jan 06 14:29 * shadowbusy is now known as shadowwalker
2014 Jan 06 14:31 <Ymgve> "find the next higher and lower primes to the given number"
2014 Jan 06 14:31 <Ymgve> yeah you won't be able to do that unless the primes are special
2014 Jan 06 14:31 <Ymgve> pretty sure there are no databases of all primes up to 230 bits
2014 Jan 06 14:32 <Lurker69> i want to lrn how to create full ASCII PGP key from n and e
2014 Jan 06 14:32 <Lurker69> this thing doesnt want to cooperate with nmubers only: http://nosuchlabs.com/

2014 Jan 06 14:33 <PersonalKilljoy> vbfh how can you tell?
2014 Jan 06 14:33 <VBFH> read in 33012014
2014 Jan 06 14:33 <VBFH> Using a distributed network, we have successfully factored the prime 90377629292003121684002147101760858109247336549001090677693 (which is not the cicada prime) into its factors.
2014 Jan 06 14:33 <masso> Ymgve: the kiev databank had the last year factors in it
2014 Jan 06 14:33 <VBFH> We take this as a proof of concept that our setup is working to some extent. We work on the nitty-gritties at the moment and let you know when a working infrastructure has been established.
2014 Jan 06 14:33 <VBFH> It took 2 minutes to do this.
2014 Jan 06 14:36 <PersonalKilljoy> sexy
2014 Jan 06 14:36 <PersonalKilljoy> you go bro!
2014 Jan 06 14:36 <Ymgve> masso: really? huh
2014 Jan 06 14:36 <masso> yup
2014 Jan 06 14:36 <grazzaB> any progress/
2014 Jan 06 14:37 <shadowwalker> BrotherBox is acting all cryptic and doing something ffs
2014 Jan 06 14:37 <grazzaB> o.0
2014 Jan 06 14:37 <brotherBox> Nothing is cryptic
2014 Jan 06 14:37 <brotherBox> Its exactly as I'm stating it
2014 Jan 06 14:38 <PersonalKilljoy> so  bro is this running already?
2014 Jan 06 14:38 <absence_> why havent you presented the information?

2014 Jan 06 14:38 <PersonalKilljoy> o ok

2014 Jan 06 14:38 <shadowwalker> Now tell me you're not being cryptic :(

2014 Jan 06 14:42 <grazzaB> lol
2014 Jan 06 14:42 <Ymgve> Lurker69: make an amazon ec2 image with it already installed
2014 Jan 06 14:43 <Ymgve> of course then you have to teach people how to use ec2

2014 Jan 06 14:44 <Ymgve> too bad I used up my free tier
2014 Jan 06 14:44 <PersonalKilljoy> so its free?
2014 Jan 06 14:44 <Ymgve> yes, but you won't do any factoring on ec2 micro instances tho
2014 Jan 06 14:44 <PersonalKilljoy> btw 2 channels is too much
2014 Jan 06 14:45 <Surtri> Why not?
2014 Jan 06 14:45 <Ymgve> they are slow
2014 Jan 06 14:45 <PersonalKilljoy> what is ec2 micro?
2014 Jan 06 14:45 <Surtri> ^
2014 Jan 06 14:47 <PersonalKilljoy> how do i notify a channel?
2014 Jan 06 14:47 <Ymgve> Lurker69: btw, do you know if there's some sieve that's accelerated by amd cards
2014 Jan 06 14:48 <marcusw> fyi, I think tekk's 3301 page has my factoring instructions on it
2014 Jan 06 14:48 <Surtri> hey marcusw
2014 Jan 06 14:48 <marcusw> I was using cygwin+cuda for nvidia gpu on windows

2014 Jan 06 14:55 <Lurker69> patince is a virtue
2014 Jan 06 14:55 <VBFH> In 2012 I factored with my GPU, took about 6 hours
2014 Jan 06 14:55 <marcusw> Lurker69: as I said, it was n_factor and VBHF
2014 Jan 06 14:55 <marcusw> oh shit it's VBFH
2014 Jan 06 14:55 <VBFH> lol, yeah

2014 Jan 06 14:56 <VBFH> now, just my 2012 prime
2014 Jan 06 14:56 <VBFH> *no
2014 Jan 06 14:56 <marcusw> oh, hmmm, I must be thinking of someone else then
2014 Jan 06 14:57 <Ymgve> how long was the 2012 prime
2014 Jan 06 14:57 <marcusw> but I'm pretty sure the nick was 4 high-entropy letters
2014 Jan 06 14:57 <marcusw> I think personal primes were around 110-120 digits
2014 Jan 06 14:57 <VBFH> wait a sec
2014 Jan 06 14:58 <Ymgve> what was the PS prime again
2014 Jan 06 15:00 <Lurker69> marcusw: n factor did it, and iirc hesaid he used some hired server farm or something, and it lasted 30 hours
2014 Jan 06 15:00 <VBFH> yeah, my 2012 one was 112 digits

2014 Jan 06 15:04 <marcusw> was that it?

2014 Jan 06 15:04 <marcusw> it's funny because you said that

2014 Jan 06 15:05 <marcusw> that's a good choice
2014 Jan 06 15:05 <marcusw> but you should use the nfs-msieve hybrid IIRC

2014 Jan 06 15:08 <Lurker69> also pls move this dscusion to #cicada 3301
2014 Jan 06 15:08 <brotherBox> "We" is the group of people working on this. I like to keep it little for efficiency reasons
2014 Jan 06 15:08 <Lurker69> cloush and few other are the re all alone
2014 Jan 06 15:09 <absence_> so do u have factors brotherBox
2014 Jan 06 15:09 <PersonalKilljoy> kk
2014 Jan 06 15:09 <brotherBox> But if you think you have something to contribute, let me know.
2014 Jan 06 15:09 <brotherBox> At the moment, two people are logged in to this very machine
2014 Jan 06 15:09 <PersonalKilljoy> Hi, do you want me to forward people to you?
2014 Jan 06 15:09 <PersonalKilljoy> i have some pms about cpu power and stuff
2014 Jan 06 15:10 <Ymgve> I gota 7870 but not sure if there are any amd sieves
2014 Jan 06 15:10 <brotherBox> You can tell them that processing power is not our main concern at the moment, and it honestly isn't.
2014 Jan 06 15:10 <Ymgve> brotherBox is the nsa
2014 Jan 06 15:10 <PersonalKilljoy> so what is?
2014 Jan 06 15:10 <PersonalKilljoy> lel
2014 Jan 06 15:11 <brotherBox> Apparently, the program we use has some problems on some OS's with downloading a program from the server and executing it due to shared libs. I can't understand it since I have never encountered the issue, so I have to trust other people, shadowwalker being one of them, to take care of that.

2014 Jan 06 15:44 <VBFH> ah, right
2014 Jan 06 15:44 <VBFH> but they are not mine
2014 Jan 06 15:44 <VBFH> I quoted doodleninja
2014 Jan 06 15:45 <marcusw> <doodleninja> is proper format
2014 Jan 06 15:46 <VBFH> that's how your client shows it, right?
2014 Jan 06 15:47 <marcusw> yis
2014 Jan 06 15:47 <VBFH> yeah, I have pidgin, no arrows there
2014 Jan 06 15:48 <marcusw> y r u using meme arrows tho?
2014 Jan 06 15:48 <VBFH> I mean there are no arrows at the names, so I have to add them and not just copy the stuff
2014 Jan 06 15:48 <PersonalKilljoy> ^
2014 Jan 06 15:49 <VBFH> that's why doodleninja had no arrows in my quote above
2014 Jan 06 15:50 <marcusw> well I mean, it was ambiguous that way
2014 Jan 06 15:50 <marcusw> arrows are standard
2014 Jan 06 15:50 <marcusw> doesn't really matter
2014 Jan 06 15:50 <VBFH> yes, I'll try to remember

2014 Jan 06 16:52 <Lurker69> uh we lost low noise channesl in topic of main channel
2014 Jan 06 16:52 <shadowwalker> ?
2014 Jan 06 16:52 <shadowwalker> What happened?
2014 Jan 06 16:54 <VBFH> >anoia: so whats all this cicada stuff
2014 Jan 06 16:54 <VBFH> such question
2014 Jan 06 16:55 <PersonalKilljoy> much hax
2014 Jan 06 16:57 <brotherBox> very cybaerpunk
2014 Jan 06 16:57 <marcusw> >mfw /mode -s
2014 Jan 06 16:57 <brotherBox> *shibepunk
2014 Jan 06 16:57 <marcusw> masso: fuck pls
2014 Jan 06 16:57 <marcusw> -.-
2014 Jan 06 16:57 <marcusw> masso: fix pls
2014 Jan 06 16:57 <Surtri> O,o
2014 Jan 06 16:57 <Surtri> masso, marcusw wants to fuck you
2014 Jan 06 16:57 <PersonalKilljoy> marcusw curious..........
2014 Jan 06 16:58 <marcusw> disclaimer: marcusw not actually sexually interested in masso
2014 Jan 06 16:58 <Surtri> That's what we all say marcusw
2014 Jan 06 16:58 <Surtri> I tell myself that too
2014 Jan 06 16:58 <PersonalKilljoy> masso: y we no +s?
2014 Jan 06 16:58 <marcusw> everyone can see our secret op chan with /whois
2014 Jan 06 16:59 <Surtri> Lol
2014 Jan 06 16:59 <Surtri> So noone whois us yet
2014 Jan 06 16:59 <Surtri> wow
2014 Jan 06 16:59 <Ymgve> average 3301er: "whats whois"
2014 Jan 06 16:59 <Surtri> I wonder how long until they see no op is trying to solve in chan till they get suspicious
2014 Jan 06 17:00 <Surtri> lol
2014 Jan 06 17:00 <Lurker69> soulseekah: you are genious!!!!!
2014 Jan 06 17:00 <Lurker69> For people who are not going to go the bruteforce way can check their p and q assumptions here: http://codeseekah.com/cicada/isp.php
2014 Jan 06 17:00 <Surtri> Lurker69: That was up for aw hile no?
2014 Jan 06 17:00 <marcusw> soulseekah is genious, this has been established
2014 Jan 06 17:01 <PersonalKilljoy> why is soulseekah no here?

2014 Jan 06 17:01 <Surtri> wtf
2014 Jan 06 17:01 <Surtri> someone invite him
2014 Jan 06 17:01 <Surtri> 1 sec
2014 Jan 06 17:01 <Ymgve> halfway considering something that tries to factor with numbers of the form 0x10000000000000000...........000000000000000000xxxxx
2014 Jan 06 17:01 <shadowwalker> soulseekah's here
2014 Jan 06 17:01 <PersonalKilljoy> where? O.o
2014 Jan 06 17:01 <Surtri> I invited him
2014 Jan 06 17:02 <PersonalKilljoy> o good
2014 Jan 06 17:02 <Ymgve> in case they wanted to see if anyone were paying attention to 30c3
2014 Jan 06 17:02 <marcusw> hmmm...both the PS and 2014 numbers in hex end in 9f
2014 Jan 06 17:03 <Surtri> I don't think he likes the idea of a secret chan
2014 Jan 06 17:03 <Ymgve> interesting, or coincidence?
2014 Jan 06 17:03 <marcusw> could anyone paste the message that the new semiprime comes from?

2014 Jan 06 17:04 <soulseekah> well
2014 Jan 06 17:04 <soulseekah> People with *nix boxes should have some work soon
2014 Jan 06 17:04 <PersonalKilljoy> its silent here
2014 Jan 06 17:04 <soulseekah> working on a distributed factoring script
2014 Jan 06 17:04 <Ymgve> marcusw: http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/CICADA_3301_2014_PUZZLE
2014 Jan 06 17:04 <PersonalKilljoy> tell us?
2014 Jan 06 17:04 <Ymgve> close to the end of the page
2014 Jan 06 17:04 <soulseekah> so will provide instructions soon
2014 Jan 06 17:04 <mlehmk> can set +p or +s
2014 Jan 06 17:04 <mlehmk> both make it kinda invisible
2014 Jan 06 17:05 <mlehmk> I have two factorizing jobs running
2014 Jan 06 17:05 <Ymgve> how many cores?
2014 Jan 06 17:05 <mlehmk> one is a factMsieve.pl script
2014 Jan 06 17:05 <mlehmk> on a Core2 Duo
2014 Jan 06 17:05 <soulseekah> I tried it no wai
2014 Jan 06 17:05 <soulseekah> I ran using msieve cuda
2014 Jan 06 17:05 <soulseekah> no wai
2014 Jan 06 17:05 <marcusw> that's how it's done though
2014 Jan 06 17:05 <soulseekah> will take 140 days
2014 Jan 06 17:05 <soulseekah> distribute!
2014 Jan 06 17:06 <marcusw> we need sage or n_factor or borken
2014 Jan 06 17:06 <soulseekah> we're working on a server and clients
2014 Jan 06 17:06 <Ymgve> whats your gpu
2014 Jan 06 17:06 <marcusw> any of those guys could solve it
2014 Jan 06 17:06 <mlehmk> another is a NFS on a Dual Xenon E3543
2014 Jan 06 17:06 <soulseekah> 2GB GeForce 680
2014 Jan 06 17:06 <soulseekah> doesn't help at all
2014 Jan 06 17:06 <soulseekah> I can't even factor a 100 digit number in 2 horus
2014 Jan 06 17:06 <Ymgve> what, you can't factor the 100 digit number on a gpu in 2 hours?
2014 Jan 06 17:07 <mlehmk> I also had the idea to install a CADO-NFS
2014 Jan 06 17:07 <mlehmk> to run it over a tor address
2014 Jan 06 17:07 <soulseekah> Ymgve: can you?
2014 Jan 06 17:07 <Ymgve> I don't have a nvidia gpu so no
2014 Jan 06 17:08 <Ymgve> but it seems strange that a powerful gpu only gives a 4x increase over cpu
2014 Jan 06 17:08 <Surtri> soulseekah: That's a better gpu then I have lol
2014 Jan 06 17:08 <Surtri> Shit
2014 Jan 06 17:08 <VBFH> I factored 112-digit in 6 hours
2014 Jan 06 17:08 <Surtri> Mine sucks
2014 Jan 06 17:08 <Surtri> Ass
2014 Jan 06 17:08 <soulseekah> hmm
2014 Jan 06 17:08 <PersonalKilljoy> ^
2014 Jan 06 17:08 <soulseekah> VBFH: using what?
2014 Jan 06 17:08 <soulseekah> msieve cuda?
2014 Jan 06 17:08 <VBFH> GPU
2014 Jan 06 17:08 <VBFH> yeah
2014 Jan 06 17:08 <soulseekah> hmm
2014 Jan 06 17:08 <soulseekah> well
2014 Jan 06 17:08 <Ymgve> maybe sieving isn't that gpu friendly
2014 Jan 06 17:08 <soulseekah> dont' know what to do now
2014 Jan 06 17:08 <mlehmk> my best score for Msieve is 8.61e-11 atm
2014 Jan 06 17:09 <Ymgve> too many branches maybe?
2014 Jan 06 17:09 <soulseekah> I can either start msieve cuda
2014 Jan 06 17:09 <VBFH> but I couldn't get CUDA running on linux
2014 Jan 06 17:09 <PersonalKilljoy> the distributed one could be reasonable
2014 Jan 06 17:09 <soulseekah> works fine for me cuda
2014 Jan 06 17:09 <soulseekah> on linux
2014 Jan 06 17:09 <soulseekah> with -g 0
2014 Jan 06 17:09 <VBFH> can't even install
2014 Jan 06 17:10 <soulseekah> pacman -S cuda
2014 Jan 06 17:10 <VBFH> but I didn't look very deep into it
2014 Jan 06 17:10 <soulseekah> so okay
2014 Jan 06 17:10 <soulseekah> the thing is tha msieve is not distributed
2014 Jan 06 17:10 <soulseekah> and it's faster to do CPU but distributed
2014 Jan 06 17:11 <soulseekah> than one msieve
2014 Jan 06 17:11 <soulseekah> for 12-24 hours
2014 Jan 06 17:11 <soulseekah> or how long will it actually take?
2014 Jan 06 17:12 <mlehmk> 12-24 days I guess
2014 Jan 06 17:12 <PersonalKilljoy> that's not very optimistic
2014 Jan 06 17:12 <marcusw> it should be possible to do in 2 days with consumer hardware
2014 Jan 06 17:12 <mlehmk> although 33ol2ol4zmiphtjz.onion took me just 8 minutes
2014 Jan 06 17:12 <marcusw> brotherBox: comments?
2014 Jan 06 17:12 <marcusw> mlehmk: you...factored that?
2014 Jan 06 17:12 <mlehmk> and that's 8 characters
2014 Jan 06 17:13 <mlehmk> No, I mean I made my own onion url with 8 pre-set characters
2014 Jan 06 17:13 <mlehmk> 33ol2ol4
2014 Jan 06 17:13 <marcusw> oh, ok
2014 Jan 06 17:13 <marcusw> make one that starts silkroad
2014 Jan 06 17:13 <marcusw> for max v&
2014 Jan 06 17:13 <Surtri> lol
2014 Jan 06 17:13 <mlehmk> although posting that URL here makes it not that hidden any more
2014 Jan 06 17:14 <Surtri> mlehmk: You made that onion?
2014 Jan 06 17:14 <mlehmk> Yes I made that onion
2014 Jan 06 17:14 <marcusw> mlehmk: directory servers can also see it...
2014 Jan 06 17:15 <PersonalKilljoy> guys, this is what cicada is listening to
2014 Jan 06 17:15 <PersonalKilljoy> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlrW9SUCINo
2014 Jan 06 17:16 <mlehmk> proof: http://33ol2ol4zmiphtjz.onion/surtri.html
2014 Jan 06 17:16 <Surtri> 1 min
2014 Jan 06 17:17 <Surtri> mlehmk: Check pm btw
2014 Jan 06 17:17 <Surtri> Lol
2014 Jan 06 17:17 <Surtri> Nice
2014 Jan 06 17:17 <mlehmk> It took me 8 mins to get that onion address done
2014 Jan 06 17:17 <mlehmk> I was lucky
2014 Jan 06 17:17 <mlehmk> And Lurker showed me
2014 Jan 06 17:18 <Ymgve> what's special about onion
2014 Jan 06 17:19 <PersonalKilljoy> 33012014
2014 Jan 06 17:19 <Ymgve> oh lol
2014 Jan 06 17:19 <PersonalKilljoy> but im out
2014 Jan 06 17:19 <PersonalKilljoy> for 2 hours
2014 Jan 06 17:19 <PersonalKilljoy> later gents
2014 Jan 06 17:19 * PersonalKilljoy is now known as AFKilljoy
2014 Jan 06 17:20 <Surtri> Bye
2014 Jan 06 17:22 <mlehmk> and no windows for cado-nfs
2014 Jan 06 17:23 <mlehmk> although MSVC is so much faster than GCC
2014 Jan 06 17:23 <mlehmk> especially when math
2014 Jan 06 17:25 <mlehmk> meh, yafu is down to using 25% again
2014 Jan 06 17:26 <Lurker69> http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/CICADA_3301_2014_PUZZLE#NEXT_STEP
2014 Jan 06 17:26 <Lurker69> lol we alredy ahve 59 comments in that article
2014 Jan 06 17:27 <mlehmk> I just wonder which is faster
2014 Jan 06 17:27 <mlehmk> factorizing or brute force plaintext guessing
2014 Jan 06 17:28 <Ymgve> definitely factoring
2014 Jan 06 17:28 <Ymgve> unless you have reason to believe the plaintext is like 8 chars or something
2014 Jan 06 17:28 <Surtri> Imo most likely an onion
2014 Jan 06 17:28 <mlehmk> could be another onion address
2014 Jan 06 17:28 <mlehmk> and there are only that many onion addresses
2014 Jan 06 17:28 <Ymgve> "only"
2014 Jan 06 17:29 <mlehmk> I think I gonna check that theory
2014 Jan 06 17:29 <mlehmk> which were those services that know onion addresses?
2014 Jan 06 17:29 <Surtri> What?
2014 Jan 06 17:29 <Ymgve> anyway I guess the size of the ciphertext reveals the approx size of the plaintext
2014 Jan 06 17:29 <mlehmk> Nope
2014 Jan 06 17:29 <Surtri> What do you mean services that know onion addresses?
2014 Jan 06 17:29 <mlehmk> Someone mentioned in here, that onion addresses are known
2014 Jan 06 17:30 <Surtri> I have no idea
2014 Jan 06 17:30 <mlehmk> So, is there a site that like has a directory of existing onion addresses?
2014 Jan 06 17:30 <mlehmk> it's OAEP which pads the plaintext for RSA::ES encryption
2014 Jan 06 17:31 <mlehmk> damnit: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_asymmetric_encryption_padding
2014 Jan 06 17:31 <mlehmk> RNG involved in OAEP, so no plaintext guessing
2014 Jan 06 17:31 <Lurker69> Ymgve: sure, i think solution to our RSA is onion
2014 Jan 06 17:32 <mlehmk> Yes, but the way OAEP works doesn't allow for plaintext guessing
2014 Jan 06 17:32 <Lurker69> http://pastebin.com/NrDwJait  solution of this it THEGAME
2014 Jan 06 17:32 <Lurker69> http://pastebin.com/xwDMTSPF  solution of this was 14 digit long number
2014 Jan 06 17:33 <Lurker69> 20*digit exactly
2014 Jan 06 17:33 <mlehmk> Doesn't matter, OAEP is being used for padding and that kind of padding adds randomness
2014 Jan 06 17:35 * Taiiwo is now known as _
2014 Jan 06 17:35 <Lurker69> question, we had similat thigs in the past
2014 Jan 06 17:36 * _ is now known as ___
2014 Jan 06 17:36 <Lurker69> in our outguessed msg we have RSA ciphertext and t strts with:
2014 Jan 06 17:36 <Lurker69> - -----BEGIN COMPRESSED RSA ENCRYPTED MESSAGE-----
2014 Jan 06 17:36 <Lurker69> Version: 1.99
2014 Jan 06 17:36 <Lurker69> when you check signature  - ----BEGIN  changes to ----BEGIN
2014 Jan 06 17:37 <Lurker69> how does PGP knoe it has tos tip on - and one space?
2014 Jan 06 17:37 <Lurker69> to strip*
2014 Jan 06 17:38 * ___ is now known as Taiiwo
2014 Jan 06 17:38 <mlehmk> It doesn't
2014 Jan 06 17:39 <mlehmk> it just looks for ----BEGIN or something
2014 Jan 06 17:39 <mlehmk> ohh!
2014 Jan 06 17:39 <mlehmk> I see now
2014 Jan 06 17:40 <mlehmk> this extra space
2014 Jan 06 17:40 <mlehmk> it's to escape, because it's a guarded block inside a guarded block
2014 Jan 06 17:40 <marcusw> yes
2014 Jan 06 17:40 <mlehmk> and guarded blocks begine with -----BEGIN
2014 Jan 06 17:40 <marcusw> you have to take out the extra "- " before feeding it to perl
2014 Jan 06 17:40 <mlehmk> and end with -----END
2014 Jan 06 17:41 <marcusw> mlehmk: it will escape anything that starts with --, actually
2014 Jan 06 17:41 <marcusw> which includes email signoffs, lol
2014 Jan 06 17:41 <mlehmk> MIME, etc
2014 Jan 06 17:41 <mlehmk> although email signatures startwith "-- "
2014 Jan 06 17:41 <mlehmk> it's an extra space there for signatures
2014 Jan 06 17:42 <masso> marcusw: what +s?
2014 Jan 06 17:43 <marcusw> masso: /mode +s
2014 Jan 06 17:43 <mlehmk> just do it
2014 Jan 06 17:43 <Lurker69> secret i think, but on feenode it doesnt make any differnce
2014 Jan 06 17:43 <mlehmk> freenode mode standard is +ns
2014 Jan 06 17:43 <Lurker69> it doesnt show channel on /whois and /list
2014 Jan 06 17:44 <mlehmk> just add it anyways
2014 Jan 06 17:44 <Lurker69> yes on /whois freenode hides channels if you are not in them, and /list
2014 Jan 06 17:44 <mlehmk> not list
2014 Jan 06 17:44 <Lurker69>  / list i s ting that scrolls up for 15 minutes if you run it
2014 Jan 06 17:44 <mlehmk> maybe you think that, cause on freenode +s is a standard mode for newly created channels
2014 Jan 06 17:45 <mlehmk> anyways, what does it hurt to +s?
2014 Jan 06 17:45 <Lurker69> s
2014 Jan 06 17:45 <Lurker69> (secret channel) 	This channel will not appear on channel lists or WHO or WHOIS output unless you are on it.
2014 Jan 06 17:46 <mlehmk> Yes... so why not turn it on?
2014 Jan 06 17:46 <masso> * 742 #cicadaops s ntcslk MODE cannot be set due to channel having an active MLOCK restriction policy
2014 Jan 06 17:47 <VBFH> Mothwing: Gah, the picture is driving me nuts, I'm familiar with the upper and lower half paintings, but I can't remember the artist for the life of me!
2014 Jan 06 17:47 <VBFH> now, after how many hours?
2014 Jan 06 17:47 <VBFH> those fuckers just don't read the wiki

2014 Jan 06 17:48 <Lurker69> i added alot  noob friendly link abrou factorization and  RSA
2014 Jan 06 17:48 <mlehmk> anyways, should we get a second message then we might have a new attack vector
2014 Jan 06 17:49 <marcusw> masso: yeah, you have to set it through chanserv then
2014 Jan 06 17:51 <Lurker69>   /msg chanserv flags #cicadaops +s
2014 Jan 06 17:51 * Lurker69 never understood logic behind user and channel modes and flags

2014 Jan 06 17:52 <masso>  = [ChanServ] +s is not registered.
2014 Jan 06 17:52 <masso> obviously
2014 Jan 06 17:53 <Lurker69>  then you need to set MLOCK  OFF

2014 Jan 06 17:56 <Lurker69> last year never more than like 60 or 80
2014 Jan 06 17:56 <masso> NOBODY
2014 Jan 06 17:57 <Lurker69> masso yes, that is why +s does nothing, only hides it on /list
2014 Jan 06 17:57 <mlehmk> I think I gonna hack up a little tiny distro up
2014 Jan 06 17:58 <Lurker69> in freenode all users have defount flag +i
2014 Jan 06 17:58 <Lurker69> i
2014 Jan 06 17:58 <Lurker69> (invisible) 	This prevents you from appearing in global WHO/WHOIS by normal users, and hides which channels you are on. It is enabled by default.
2014 Jan 06 17:58 <mlehmk> one that you can burn on a CD and put into a PC to make distributed computing
2014 Jan 06 17:58 <mlehmk> well, if you can't set +s, set +p
2014 Jan 06 17:58 <Lurker69> no +p
2014 Jan 06 17:58 <mlehmk> what's wrong with p?
2014 Jan 06 17:58 <mlehmk> although cado-nfs says, cracking 130 digits takes about 10 days on one core
2014 Jan 06 17:59 <mlehmk> 10 people, 24h
2014 Jan 06 17:59 <Lurker69> ah p is paranoid
2014 Jan 06 17:59 <Lurker69> ok p also doesnt matter
2014 Jan 06 17:59 <Ymgve> so about 1 hour on 240 cores
2014 Jan 06 17:59 <Lurker69> when i said no i meant p is password
2014 Jan 06 17:59 <Lurker69> passwords are annoying
2014 Jan 06 18:00 <Ymgve> there are 321 people in 33012014 - let's get cracking!
2014 Jan 06 18:00 * Quits: shadowwalker (~shadowwal@unaffiliated/shadowwalker1337) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2014 Jan 06 18:00 <mlehmk> yeah, creating an automatic booting CD for distributed computing might take longer than cracking then
2014 Jan 06 18:00 <Lurker69> soulseekahs guesing script might word
2014 Jan 06 18:00 <Lurker69> work
2014 Jan 06 18:00 <Ymgve> just tell me what to do and you have my i5
2014 Jan 06 18:00 <Ymgve> should help a little bit
2014 Jan 06 18:01 <mlehmk> All you would need to do is boot from a CD and let it run
2014 Jan 06 18:01 <Ymgve> I want to be in windows tho
2014 Jan 06 18:01 <mlehmk> it'd boot a live image of debian and compile a cado-nfs for your machine, run a tor client and get payload from my server
2014 Jan 06 18:02 <mlehmk> well, alternatively virtualbox or vmware should be supported
2014 Jan 06 18:02 <Ymgve> wouldn't that severely restrict performance
2014 Jan 06 18:02 <mlehmk> not the best, but better than nothing
2014 Jan 06 18:02 <mlehmk> although it'd be good if you could dedicate the PC for cracking over night or something
2014 Jan 06 18:03 <Ymgve> I'll try to convince my flatmate maybe
2014 Jan 06 18:03 <mlehmk> so, soulseekah, how far are you with your distributed computing plans?

2014 Jan 06 18:17 <mlehmk> yafu is in the next phase
2014 Jan 06 18:19 <mlehmk> so, I have a full polynomial phase on the Dual Xeon already
2014 Jan 06 18:20 <mlehmk> its doing lattice sieving as it looks
2014 Jan 06 18:20 <VBFH> nice
2014 Jan 06 18:20 <VBFH> I'm still at poly
2014 Jan 06 18:21 <mlehmk> Well, it's a Dual Xeon. I have 8x 2333
2014 Jan 06 18:21 <Ymgve> fuck it, giving up cado-nfs compiling under cygwin
2014 Jan 06 18:21 <mlehmk> cado-nfs 2.0 on mingw
2014 Jan 06 18:21 <mlehmk> but it's poor performance
2014 Jan 06 18:21 <VBFH> 4x3.3 for me, lel
2014 Jan 06 18:28 <mlehmk> testing cado-nfs with a 60 digit rsa number
2014 Jan 06 18:29 <mlehmk> and it looks like it could be distributed through tor network
2014 Jan 06 18:29 <mlehmk> only problem I see with people fetching workload which they never finish
2014 Jan 06 18:30 <Ymgve> just do it twice
2014 Jan 06 18:30 <Ymgve> or micromanage workloads
2014 Jan 06 18:30 <mlehmk> maybe the server would just distribute the workloads round robin whenever someone requests a block
2014 Jan 06 18:30 <mlehmk> of all non-finished ones
2014 Jan 06 18:36 <mlehmk> The lattice process is finishing up
2014 Jan 06 18:36 <Ymgve> for a test number?
2014 Jan 06 18:36 <Ymgve> or the real deal?
2014 Jan 06 18:36 <mlehmk> for our real number
2014 Jan 06 18:37 <soulseekah> anyone ready to run CPU-base linux factroing clients pm me for invites
2014 Jan 06 18:37 <mlehmk> ohh cool!
2014 Jan 06 18:37 <mlehmk> you did it
2014 Jan 06 18:37 <soulseekah> only linux, no windows fags
2014 Jan 06 18:37 <soulseekah> thanks
2014 Jan 06 18:37 <Surtri> lol
2014 Jan 06 18:37 <Ymgve> do you accept vm
2014 Jan 06 18:37 <Surtri> tell that to #windows
2014 Jan 06 18:37 <Taiiwo> soulseekah: I'll take it
2014 Jan 06 18:37 <soulseekah> vm should work
2014 Jan 06 18:37 <soulseekah> yes
2014 Jan 06 18:37 <mlehmk> VM is better than nothing
2014 Jan 06 18:37 <Ymgve> or do you have a nice livecd
2014 Jan 06 18:38 <Taiiwo> soulseekah: Does that mean it's centralized?
2014 Jan 06 18:38 <soulseekah> we don't have patch instructions for windows sorry
2014 Jan 06 18:38 <soulseekah> it's decentralized
2014 Jan 06 18:38 <mlehmk> ohh, another lattice process
2014 Jan 06 18:38 <Taiiwo> Ohh.
2014 Jan 06 18:38 <soulseekah> master server -> many clients
2014 Jan 06 18:38 <mlehmk> I have a cado-nfs 2.0 compile ready
2014 Jan 06 18:38 <mlehmk> I'm just testing with a 60 digit rsa one
2014 Jan 06 18:39 <Lurker69> <mm_freak_> anyway, if anyone is interested, there doesn't seem to be a short power sum representation for this cicada modulus
2014 Jan 06 18:39 <soulseekah> mlehmk: you need a patched client
2014 Jan 06 18:40 <mlehmk> why?
2014 Jan 06 18:41 <soulseekah> because the server sends its fucking binaries
2014 Jan 06 18:41 <soulseekah> to clients
2014 Jan 06 18:41 <soulseekah> and they don't work
2014 Jan 06 18:41 <soulseekah> so you need to pathc the client to not accept binaries from the master server
2014 Jan 06 18:41 <soulseekah> and use your native ones
2014 Jan 06 18:42 <mlehmk> o.o
2014 Jan 06 18:42 <mlehmk> that is silly
2014 Jan 06 18:43 <mlehmk> can you hook me up with these?
2014 Jan 06 18:43 <mlehmk> I might build a live cd that can be booted to even those windows users can join in the computation
2014 Jan 06 18:44 <soulseekah> it's not silly if all is running 1 distrib
2014 Jan 06 18:44 <soulseekah> and one arch

2014 Jan 06 21:48 <Ymgve> wonder how much this would cost doing on amazon ec2
2014 Jan 06 21:52 <L0j1k> $1500/month
2014 Jan 06 21:52 <L0j1k> for one GPU CUDE instance
2014 Jan 06 21:52 <L0j1k> Ymgve i priced it out

2014 Jan 06 21:58 <Ymgve> also not sure if CUDA is more cost effective than raw CPU here
2014 Jan 06 22:03 <L0j1k> i always assumed CUDA would be about an order of magnitude better than an average CPU core at integer operations
2014 Jan 06 22:03 <L0j1k> but i really don't know
2014 Jan 06 22:05 <Ymgve> looks interesting https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~nadiah/projects/faas/

2014 Jan 07 16:20 <MassoBot> Changes were too long to post. File changes are in lines: [1]
2014 Jan 07 16:24 <mlehmk> Obviously not
2014 Jan 07 16:24 <mlehmk> it prints the same
2014 Jan 07 16:26 <mlehmk> Anyways, the current puzzle is about time... to be patient
2014 Jan 07 16:27 <masso> it prints this everytime the data changes. He doesn't post the whole string each time cause I set him to maxpostlen 20

2014 Jan 07 16:28 <MassoBot> Hello. I'm a watchbot, monitoring https://cu343l33nqaekrnw.onion atm
2014 Jan 07 16:28 <mlehmk> What if the purpose of this test is to not query that address at all?
2014 Jan 07 16:29 <mlehmk> also, I see thes 34 31 33 in that onion address, which is ascii for 413
2014 Jan 07 16:30 <masso> it's 34 3l 33
2014 Jan 07 16:30 <Ymgve> yeah but you can't have 1 in an onion
2014 Jan 07 16:30 <Ymgve> it _is_ strange that there are so many numbers at the start
2014 Jan 07 16:31 <masso> not query that address? what do you mean?
2014 Jan 07 16:31 <mlehmk> Yeah, that's cause about the http://33ol2ol4zmiphtjz.onion/
2014 Jan 07 16:31 <mlehmk> Like if patience is virtue, maybe the puzzle unsolves when the server is not accessed for a long time
2014 Jan 07 16:32 <mlehmk> since there are no 0 or 1 in onion addresses, you can use o and l as substitutes

2014 Jan 07 16:33 <masso> sorry I don't get it?
2014 Jan 07 16:34 <mlehmk> I mean, that address has to be left alone for some long duration
2014 Jan 07 16:34 <masso> there are 300+ users in the chan who access the site all the time

2014 Jan 07 16:37 <mlehmk> an address that begins with something that looks like 33012014
2014 Jan 07 16:38 <masso> oh, sorry... didn't get it :)
2014 Jan 07 16:38 <Ymgve> but it's not ingame
2014 Jan 07 16:38 <mlehmk> nope, it's separate

2014 Jan 07 20:05 <mlehmk> nope
2014 Jan 07 20:06 <mlehmk> but if you mean those "- " then yes
2014 Jan 07 20:08 <marcusw> yes
2014 Jan 07 20:08 <marcusw> that's what I meant
2014 Jan 07 20:09 <marcusw> you should verify the pgp yourself

2014 Jan 07 20:11 <mlehmk> finally worked on a linux box
2014 Jan 07 20:11 <mlehmk> I was looking if there was any extra data except the onion url and yes, there's a newline first and a newline after
2014 Jan 07 20:11 <marcusw> heh
2014 Jan 07 20:11 <marcusw> yeah
2014 Jan 07 20:12 <marcusw> you sure perl didn't do that with the print?

2014 Jan 07 20:16 <marcusw> NOTHING can drown tj out

2014 Jan 07 20:17 <Ymgve> on a whim I'm trying xor with skips between each byte
2014 Jan 07 20:17 <iII> lol
2014 Jan 07 20:17 <Ymgve> but nothing so far
2014 Jan 07 20:18 <iII> I do suspect xoring all the things will need to happen eventually

2014 Jan 07 20:21 <mlehmk> btw, 199 bytes only have 7.67 bits of entropy at most. They cannot have more
2014 Jan 07 20:21 <mlehmk> bits per byte I mean
2014 Jan 07 20:21 <mlehmk> you need at least 256 bytes to have 8 bits of entropy
2014 Jan 07 20:21 <mlehmk> per byte, again

2014 Jan 07 20:24 <marcusw> 199 looks like 6.88-7.03 or so

2014 Jan 07 20:49 <marcusw> I can just +v the smart people and +q the retards
2014 Jan 07 20:49 <mlehmk> does anyone still have the binary that was published on 1231507051321 twitter?
2014 Jan 07 20:49 <marcusw> :D
2014 Jan 07 20:49 <marcusw> or
2014 Jan 07 20:49 <marcusw> +v the smart people and +m when I have a headache
2014 Jan 07 20:49 <marcusw> :D
2014 Jan 07 20:49 <mlehmk> +v is for idiots
2014 Jan 07 20:49 <mlehmk> it's the "Vollidiot" flag
2014 Jan 07 20:49 <mlehmk> which is german for a blatant stupid
2014 Jan 07 20:50 <PersonalKilljoy> isnt +i for idiots?
2014 Jan 07 20:50 <mlehmk> +i is invite only
2014 Jan 07 20:50 <PersonalKilljoy> i thought idiots only
2014 Jan 07 20:50 <marcusw> mlehmk: yes, to keep idiots out
2014 Jan 07 20:50 <mlehmk> anyways: https://twitter.com/1231507051321
2014 Jan 07 20:50 <mlehmk> the first image was posted on there
2014 Jan 07 20:50 <mlehmk> but there is also a binary from last year. Does anyone still have that?
2014 Jan 07 20:51 <marcusw> it was on the iso
2014 Jan 07 20:51 <marcusw> there's a link on the wiki
2014 Jan 07 20:53 <PersonalKilljoy> i have iso here
2014 Jan 07 20:54 <masso> mlehmk: it's somewhere in the wikia
2014 Jan 07 20:54 <mlehmk> I found the tweets, that's enough to make a binary from it
2014 Jan 07 20:54 <marcusw> < fagmuffinz_> The reslut is my ex actually

2014 Jan 07 21:04 <marcusw> < fyodorovitch> I'm going to guess that this is asm being released in  reverse
2014 Jan 07 21:05 <mlehmk> Has anyone yet decoded the tweets from last year?
2014 Jan 07 21:05 <mlehmk> Because it looks like a jpg image to me
2014 Jan 07 21:06 <marcusw> it is
2014 Jan 07 21:06 <marcusw> but IIRC you have to xor it with something
2014 Jan 07 21:06 <marcusw> read the wiki
2014 Jan 07 21:06 <marcusw> noob :p
2014 Jan 07 21:08 <mlehmk> Uhm, well, my result was an ID3 tag...
2014 Jan 07 21:08 <mlehmk> About Parable 1,595,277,641.Like the instar, tunneling to the surface\nWe must shed our own circumferences;\nFind the divinity within and emerge.
2014 Jan 07 21:08 <mlehmk> I guess it is not related then
2014 Jan 07 21:09 <Ymgve> related to what?
2014 Jan 07 21:09 <mlehmk> well, I thought, since the first image of this year was twittered from the same account as last year
2014 Jan 07 21:10 <mlehmk> and looking at the tweets in binary looked awfully similar to a jpg image to me
2014 Jan 07 21:10 <mlehmk> so I compared it with another jpg file to just see they were striking similar, so I XORed them, which resulted into a ID3 tag, which I then identified as the .mp3 file
2014 Jan 07 21:11 <Ymgve> yeah
2014 Jan 07 21:11 <marcusw> 15:10 < avacado> what architecture are you disassembling in?
2014 Jan 07 21:11 <marcusw> 15:11 < mtndew> avocado: i d assume linux
2014 Jan 07 21:11 <masso> http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/Twitter_finished_HEX_DUMP
2014 Jan 07 21:11 <mlehmk> Yeah, I just solved that one myself a moment ago
2014 Jan 07 21:11 <Ymgve> if you xor the full image with 761.mp3 from the cicada cd image you get a text file
2014 Jan 07 21:12 <Ymgve> which is a base64 encoded cicada
2014 Jan 07 21:12 <mlehmk> Which I would have done right now
2014 Jan 07 21:12 <Ymgve> no wait, I'm wrong
2014 Jan 07 21:13 <Ymgve> the tweets xor 761.mp3 gives the alphabet image
2014 Jan 07 21:13 <mlehmk> Yes it does
2014 Jan 07 21:13 <mlehmk> No need to proceed any further
2014 Jan 07 21:13 <mlehmk> for XOR we need two things
2014 Jan 07 21:13 <mlehmk> right now we have only one path, not two
2014 Jan 07 21:14 <mlehmk> Was there any connection between the last two quests in before?

2014 Jan 07 21:15 <marcusw> mlehmk: the important thing is that we need two high-entropy things
2014 Jan 07 21:15 <mlehmk> what has Wind said in IRC?
2014 Jan 07 21:15 <marcusw> mlehmk: you can't take a low-entropy thing and a high-entropy thing, xor them together, and get a low-entropy thing
2014 Jan 07 21:16 <Ymgve> if you  XOR the alphabet image with one of the data files from the iso, you get a text file which contains a base64 encoded cicada
2014 Jan 07 21:16 <mlehmk> we have a second high-entropy thing
2014 Jan 07 21:18 <mlehmk> Okay, I tried XOR between the onion and the Cyphertext
2014 Jan 07 21:18 <mlehmk> no meaningful result either
2014 Jan 07 21:22 <mlehmk> has anyone factored 10412790658919985359827898739594318956404425106955675643739226952372682423852959081739834390370374475764863415203423499357108713631 yet?
2014 Jan 07 21:23 <mlehmk> that's the composite that was added to the last public message in 2012

2014 Jan 07 21:29 <Ymgve> what was the link
2014 Jan 07 21:29 <Ymgve> ah, found it
2014 Jan 07 21:34 <mlehmk> <@Ymgve> Did anyone try pinging the onion and capturing the return packets?

2014 Jan 07 21:38 <marcusw> oh, btw
2014 Jan 07 21:38 <Lurker69> anyone in #3301cado? or is it RIP?

2014 Jan 07 21:40 <marcusw> so 8k
2014 Jan 07 21:40 <marcusw> but you can do that over tor too
2014 Jan 07 21:40 <Ymgve> I really liked when minecraft-notch made his ARG thingie
2014 Jan 07 21:40 <masso> Lurker69: L0j1k is in there afaik

2014 Jan 07 21:41 <Ymgve> 4 out of 9 of the last bytes have been digits

2014 Jan 07 23:05 <Tech1> i want to update my dropbox
2014 Jan 07 23:05 <Ymgve> think so
2014 Jan 07 23:05 <NEM0> Ymgve: just a quick thought: can you try it against the twitter profile pic?
2014 Jan 07 23:06 <NEM0> the pic isn't the same as last year
2014 Jan 07 23:06 <Ymgve> it's not?
2014 Jan 07 23:06 <NEM0> no, it's smaller
2014 Jan 07 23:06 <NEM0> twitter modified the profile pages
2014 Jan 07 23:07 <NEM0> pics are not shown in fullsize anymore afaik
2014 Jan 07 23:07 <Ymgve> huh, there are 781 spaces after the end of the png footer
2014 Jan 07 23:07 <NEM0> yup, seen that
2014 Jan 07 23:08 <PersonalKilljoy> https://infotomb.com/u81ns
2014 Jan 07 23:08 <NEM0> 781 isn't prime btw, checked that too
2014 Jan 07 23:08 <PersonalKilljoy> this is the bitmap
2014 Jan 07 23:08 <PersonalKilljoy> check it out
2014 Jan 07 23:08 <Tech1> pjk, what's that from?
2014 Jan 07 23:09 <NEM0> PersonalKilljoy: pic broken for me
2014 Jan 07 23:09 * Quits: mlehmk (~mlehmk@pd95cf61b.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Remote host closed the connection)
2014 Jan 07 23:09 <Tech1> works here
2014 Jan 07 23:09 <PersonalKilljoy> works for me....
2014 Jan 07 23:09 <PersonalKilljoy> btw who are you nemo?
2014 Jan 07 23:09 <NEM0> nope
2014 Jan 07 23:09 <NEM0> masso
2014 Jan 07 23:10 <NEM0> camouflage mode lol
2014 Jan 07 23:10 <Tech1> lol
2014 Jan 07 23:10 <Ymgve> PersonalKilljoy: where did that image come from?
2014 Jan 07 23:10 <Ymgve> also doesn't work here
2014 Jan 07 23:10 <Ymgve> no luck xoring with the twitter image
2014 Jan 07 23:10 <PersonalKilljoy> i created it
2014 Jan 07 23:10 <PersonalKilljoy> is just a bitmap
2014 Jan 07 23:10 <Ymgve> in postscript?
2014 Jan 07 23:10 <PersonalKilljoy> but i got different result than the one from printscreen
2014 Jan 07 23:10 <PersonalKilljoy> nah in python
2014 Jan 07 23:11 <NEM0> http://prntscr.com/2hen5w
2014 Jan 07 23:11 <PersonalKilljoy> even though they should be equal
2014 Jan 07 23:11 <Ymgve> it's .eps here
2014 Jan 07 23:11 <PersonalKilljoy> its eps
2014 Jan 07 23:11 <PersonalKilljoy> my linux opens it without probs....
2014 Jan 07 23:11 <Ymgve> I get invalid EPS file
2014 Jan 07 23:12 <PersonalKilljoy> i can printscreen if you want to....
2014 Jan 07 23:12 <PersonalKilljoy> and i downloaded it and it works
2014 Jan 07 23:12 <PersonalKilljoy> let me see if i can save in different format
2014 Jan 07 23:13 <Ymgve> but what is it?
2014 Jan 07 23:14 <Tech1> i'm still lost on how you made it
2014 Jan 07 23:14 <PersonalKilljoy> sooo
2014 Jan 07 23:14 <PersonalKilljoy> i read the thing on wiki right?
2014 Jan 07 23:14 <NEM0> <godbert> mendelbroh(SP?) would be proud
2014 Jan 07 23:14 <PersonalKilljoy> i saw this
2014 Jan 07 23:14 <PersonalKilljoy> http://postimg.org/image/yukab2cjx/
2014 Jan 07 23:15 <Tech1> medelbro is a dude i work with
2014 Jan 07 23:15 <PersonalKilljoy> 25 per line 63 lines
2014 Jan 07 23:15 <PersonalKilljoy> i used pyx library
2014 Jan 07 23:15 <Tech1> mendelbro*
2014 Jan 07 23:15 <PersonalKilljoy> to create a bitmap
2014 Jan 07 23:15 <Tech1> NEM0: what was the context?
2014 Jan 07 23:15 <PersonalKilljoy> + some perl and unix magic to change hex into bit values
2014 Jan 07 23:17 <NEM0> I have no idea... seems no context at all lol
2014 Jan 07 23:18 <Ymgve> PersonalKilljoy: why are you creating these stupid formats and not bmp or png or something
2014 Jan 07 23:18 <PersonalKilljoy> since this weird lib has only eps and pdf
2014 Jan 07 23:18 <Ymgve> lol
2014 Jan 07 23:18 <Ymgve> use PIL
2014 Jan 07 23:18 <PersonalKilljoy> http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/CICADA_3301_2014_PUZZLE?diff=prev&oldid=7884
2014 Jan 07 23:18 <PersonalKilljoy> that is the original source
2014 Jan 07 23:18 <Ymgve> I know
2014 Jan 07 23:19 <Ymgve> but I've never gotten close to that output
2014 Jan 07 23:19 <Tech1> isn't PIL depreciated?
2014 Jan 07 23:19 <PersonalKilljoy> what's pil?
2014 Jan 07 23:19 <Ymgve> python image library
2014 Jan 07 23:19 <Tech1> python image lib
2014 Jan 07 23:19 <Ymgve> I'm still on python2 soo
2014 Jan 07 23:19 <PersonalKilljoy> i used pyx
2014 Jan 07 23:19 <PersonalKilljoy> some custom lib
2014 Jan 07 23:20 <PersonalKilljoy> argh i fucked up
2014 Jan 07 23:20 <PersonalKilljoy> used 35 instead of 25
2014 Jan 07 23:20 <PersonalKilljoy> let me fix that
2014 Jan 07 23:21 <Tech1> right ym, but i thought pip suggests something else?
2014 Jan 07 23:21 <Tech1> maybe not
2014 Jan 07 23:32 <PersonalKilljoy> hmm
2014 Jan 07 23:32 <PersonalKilljoy> thats pretty weird
2014 Jan 07 23:32 <PersonalKilljoy> let me check sth
2014 Jan 07 23:32 <Tech1> https://github.com/python-imaging/Pillow
2014 Jan 07 23:32 <Tech1> the new PIL fork

2014 Jan 07 23:44 <PersonalKilljoy> ymgve you have it?
2014 Jan 07 23:44 <PersonalKilljoy> look at the top
2014 Jan 07 23:44 <PersonalKilljoy> when you minimalize it
2014 Jan 07 23:44 <NEM0> how is this generated?

2014 Jan 07 23:55 <PersonalKilljoy> im not sure who stumbled upon bitmap idea
2014 Jan 07 23:55 <PersonalKilljoy> and why it should be 25 pixels in line
2014 Jan 07 23:56 <Ymgve> some anonymous editor on the wiki
2014 Jan 07 23:58 <NEM0> 25 seems very unlikely to me

2014 Jan 08 00:30 <brotherBox> Nothing else to say about that.
2014 Jan 08 00:31 <NEM0> I'll ask staff
2014 Jan 08 00:31 <PersonalKilljoy> oki
2014 Jan 08 00:31 <PersonalKilljoy> any of you think that he understand what is going on in solvers or 2014?
2014 Jan 08 00:32 <PersonalKilljoy> i feel like shouting during storm or blizzard
2014 Jan 08 00:32 <brotherBox> PersonalKilljoy, I personally don't. But then again, its not quite my duty to.
2014 Jan 08 00:32 <PersonalKilljoy> im not sure if anybody can read what i post there because its insta gone
2014 Jan 08 00:32 <brotherBox> The stream hasn't died yet
2014 Jan 08 00:32 <PersonalKilljoy> ^
2014 Jan 08 00:32 <PersonalKilljoy> then i dunno
2014 Jan 08 00:32 <brotherBox> And until then, any real attempt to do cryptanalysis is pointless
2014 Jan 08 00:32 <PersonalKilljoy> probably smaller chans or sth
2014 Jan 08 00:32 <brotherBox> I would start off by calculating the IC, length, char freq's and so forth
2014 Jan 08 00:33 <brotherBox> But every stat you generate is bing void after 5-10 minutes.
2014 Jan 08 00:33 <brotherBox> s/bing/rendered
2014 Jan 08 00:33 <brotherBox> Therefore I don't really participate in efforts going on at the moment.

2014 Jan 08 00:38 <Lurker69> ...
2014 Jan 08 00:38 <Lurker69> on second thought
2014 Jan 08 00:38 <Lurker69> rather not
2014 Jan 08 00:39 <Lurker69> if we put adress on wiki everybod y can chande it, you cant post  wallets on public colaborytive docs
2014 Jan 08 00:41 <Ymgve> can't you put it in the html templates?
2014 Jan 08 00:41 <Ymgve> thos aren't user-editable are they
2014 Jan 08 00:44 <brotherBox> So
2014 Jan 08 00:44 <brotherBox> I just went to the wikia IRC on Freenode and talked to the people
2014 Jan 08 00:44 * Joins: mlehmk (~mlehmk@pd95cf61b.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
2014 Jan 08 00:44 <brotherBox> They said, the best thing to do would write her a message to remind her of the urgency of the situation. I will do that.
2014 Jan 08 00:44 <brotherBox> her == the girl/woman who is responsible for this task.
2014 Jan 08 00:45 <NEM0> idiots in #freenode...
2014 Jan 08 00:52 <brotherBox> Hey people, I am writing this on the wall of the one who does the adoptions:
2014 Jan 08 00:52 <brotherBox> Hey Merrystar,
2014 Jan 08 00:52 <brotherBox> I am a representative of the community behind the Uncovering Cicada wiki. I have left a request for adoption on December 30th which remained unanswered. The topic this wiki is dealing with experiences current developments, as in, as I am typing this. The old admin is, as stated in the original request, unavailable. Therefore, I like to politely urge you to get in contact with me about the situation.
2014 Jan 08 00:52 <brotherBox> If my statistics make me ineligible, I would greatly appreciate if you let me know and give another candidate who is more active on the wiki.
2014 Jan 08 00:52 <brotherBox> Thanks for your time, consideration and effort.
2014 Jan 08 00:53 <brotherBox> Any comments?
2014 Jan 08 00:56 * rr645-afk is now known as rr645
2014 Jan 08 00:59 <mlehmk> Okay, I did two test. The thing is not a gpg-amored text XORed with any of the 3301.iso. Also the thing is not a JPEG file XORed with any of the 3301.iso
2014 Jan 08 01:00 <mlehmk> Guys, do we have any plaintext guesses what it might be, when XORed?
2014 Jan 08 01:01 <Ymgve> mp3, jpeg, png, gif, ascii?
2014 Jan 08 01:01 <brotherBox> ^
2014 Jan 08 01:01 <rr645> PGP?
2014 Jan 08 01:01 <brotherBox> mlehmk, I'd run a "file" on the result, if its not too resource intensive
2014 Jan 08 01:01 <Ymgve> ascii armored PGP is ascii
2014 Jan 08 01:02 <rr645> I knew that, and wasn't being dumb at all.
2014 Jan 08 01:02 <Ymgve> if cicada uses raw binary PGP then they suck
2014 Jan 08 01:03 <rr645> a) I know see that mlehmk just tested that theory, b) they suck and are mean, that's the point of this puzzle c) it's so cold that half my plumbing won't work oh god
2014 Jan 08 01:04 <brotherBox> Lol about c)
2014 Jan 08 01:06 <mlehmk> Yeah, my method was this
2014 Jan 08 01:06 <mlehmk> binary = hex from onion site converted to a binary file
2014 Jan 08 01:06 <mlehmk> and then otpxor with various plaintext guesses to get a key
2014 Jan 08 01:07 <mlehmk> like the ----- of GPG messages or this JFIF header which is always the same from cicada
2014 Jan 08 01:07 <mlehmk> then I took the first 4 bytes and searched for those in this 3301.iso
2014 Jan 08 01:07 <mlehmk> should I have made a match somewhere it might be a hint about a possible otp key from that iso
2014 Jan 08 01:08 <mlehmk> I also tried the ID3 tag that cicada puts at the beginning of their MP3 files and used that to search for a key inside that iso
2014 Jan 08 01:09 <mlehmk> I even used Psychomachia as a guess for the plaintext

2014 Jan 08 01:19 <mlehmk> anyways, if you see 4E 6F BF 97 64 BC 76 29 93 94 57 CA 73 55 6A 60 15 69 8F 69 CF 9A A0 0E C1 8F 81 19 BB B5 DA 47 somewhere, then it's very possibly the beginning of an opt key to decrypt that text from this onion
2014 Jan 08 01:23 <rr645> Since non-ops are trying to have a sane conversation about decoding this I'm trying to get an onion-only discussion started in #oniondecipher

2014 Jan 09 19:04 <NiceLurk> clarify something
2014 Jan 09 19:04 <NiceLurk> 2 jpgs
2014 Jan 09 19:05 <NiceLurk> one from start one from end
2014 Jan 09 19:05 <masso> what?
2014 Jan 09 19:05 <masso> pic?
2014 Jan 09 19:05 <NiceLurk> was second one reversed or not?
2014 Jan 09 19:05 <masso> server pic?
2014 Jan 09 19:05 <NiceLurk> yeah grom string on server-staturs
2014 Jan 09 19:06 <masso> I'll have a look
2014 Jan 09 19:06 <NiceLurk>     bytes 0xFF, 0xD8 indicate start of image
2014 Jan 09 19:06 <NiceLurk>     bytes 0xFF, 0xD9 indicate end of image
2014 Jan 09 19:06 <NiceLurk> just check lst two bytes
2014 Jan 09 19:07 <NiceLurk> if FF D9 then second pic is not revesed
2014 Jan 09 19:07 <NiceLurk> is D8 FF  then it is reversed
2014 Jan 09 19:07 <mlehmk> FF D8 FF E0
2014 Jan 09 19:07 <mlehmk> the FF E0 is usually used and so far has been used by Cicada
2014 Jan 09 19:09 <NiceLurk> so second pic is reversed
2014 Jan 09 19:09 <NiceLurk> beginning bytes of jpg are on end ofstring
2014 Jan 09 19:09 <NiceLurk> another question
2014 Jan 09 19:09 <NiceLurk>              To replicate this:
2014 Jan 09 19:09 <NiceLurk>                 copy string above in HEX field of : http://home.paulschou.net/tools/xlate/ and press decode
2014 Jan 09 19:09 <NiceLurk>                 copy text from TEXT to HEX and press decode again
2014 Jan 09 19:09 <NiceLurk>                 repeat previous step, copy text from TEXT to HEX and pres decode again
2014 Jan 09 19:09 <NiceLurk>                 in tetx field yyou should see 5x5 square below

2014 Jan 09 19:11 <NiceLurk> why some digits doesnt work?
2014 Jan 09 19:11 <masso> ya, but the image between magic# and EOF
2014 Jan 09 19:11 <NiceLurk> no i just posted that string from http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/CICADA_3301_2014_PUZZLE_FACTS_PART_3#BEGINNING_OF_REASONABLE_EXPLANATION
2014 Jan 09 19:11 <marcusw> ah crap
2014 Jan 09 19:12 <marcusw> wiki must be wrong then
2014 Jan 09 19:12 <NiceLurk> to xlate hex and copy from text to hex, repeat one more
2014 Jan 09 19:12 <marcusw> does anyone have the raw file and addresses of the data?
2014 Jan 09 19:12 <NiceLurk> and you get almost right result
2014 Jan 09 19:12 <NiceLurk> few numbers dont work
2014 Jan 09 19:12 <PersonalKilljoy> marcusw: which data?
2014 Jan 09 19:12 <NiceLurk> and linebrakes, but linebrakes nare normal onot to work

2014 Jan 09 19:17 <masso> the hex string from the status page is somehow not correct
2014 Jan 09 19:17 <mlehmk> huh? what?
2014 Jan 09 19:17 <PersonalKilljoy> how do you mean?
2014 Jan 09 19:18 <masso> it contains non hex data
2014 Jan 09 19:18 <mlehmk> you mean the hex string sandwiched between the pictures?
2014 Jan 09 19:18 <PersonalKilljoy> it changes ya know?
2014 Jan 09 19:18 <masso> says hxd when I try to insert
2014 Jan 09 19:18 <mlehmk> Just reverse that hex string before making it binary

2014 Jan 09 19:21 <marcusw> NiceLurk: want to know the real reason?
2014 Jan 09 19:21 <PersonalKilljoy> confirm hexdump change?
2014 Jan 09 19:21 <NiceLurk> this book is actual setted as books for printing should be done, it even has bleeding edge i think
2014 Jan 09 19:22 <NiceLurk> marcusw: like they need so bid pixeld that they can fir outguess in white space?
2014 Jan 09 19:22 <marcusw> NiceLurk: yis
2014 Jan 09 19:22 <NiceLurk> but they are all exactly same width
2014 Jan 09 19:22 <mlehmk> nope, exactly the same as before
2014 Jan 09 19:22 <PersonalKilljoy> guise
2014 Jan 09 19:22 <PersonalKilljoy> what about that hexdump?
2014 Jan 09 19:22 <NiceLurk> even one from first onion
2014 Jan 09 19:22 <PersonalKilljoy> got a pm about the change but i am not in the topic
2014 Jan 09 19:22 <NiceLurk> which is imo meant to be cover
2014 Jan 09 19:22 <PersonalKilljoy> mlehmk: ok thx
2014 Jan 09 19:23 <masso> mlehmk: yes, right. but I mean: Go on status page now, coy hex, try to safe it in hxd. Says :Contains non hex values
2014 Jan 09 19:23 <NiceLurk> ?
2014 Jan 09 19:23 <mlehmk> I already did it
2014 Jan 09 19:23 <mlehmk> it contains hex values in reverse
2014 Jan 09 19:23 <mlehmk> check my pastebin how it decodes
2014 Jan 09 19:23 <masso> reversed hex is still hex
2014 Jan 09 19:23 <PersonalKilljoy> mlehmk i redirected the hexdump guy to you
2014 Jan 09 19:23 <PersonalKilljoy> since i don't know shit about this part
2014 Jan 09 19:24 <mlehmk> yeah, but the reversed hex makes sense
2014 Jan 09 19:24 <NiceLurk> status page doesnt have rversed bytes
2014 Jan 09 19:24 <NiceLurk>  ff d8
2014 Jan 09 19:25 <masso> yes, but I can't even save it as bin reversed or not because it has non hex data in it somewhere
2014 Jan 09 19:25 <NiceLurk> http://prntscr.com/2hw7cl
2014 Jan 09 19:25 <masso> non hex data is ie. g h i j k l m n o
2014 Jan 09 19:26 <NiceLurk> maybe you selected part of text with string
2014 Jan 09 19:26 <NiceLurk> on the bootom is also text
2014 Jan 09 19:26 <masso> and you can reverse 0g as often as you like, it's still non hex
2014 Jan 09 19:27 <NiceLurk> masso i just tried it and it works for me
2014 Jan 09 19:27 <NiceLurk> select only string
2014 Jan 09 19:27 <mlehmk> reverse the hex, not the binary
2014 Jan 09 19:29 <mlehmk> here, that's the one sandwiched between the jpgs

2014 Jan 09 19:29 <mlehmk> I guess you are talking about that hexdump not making sense
2014 Jan 09 19:29 <mlehmk> when you reverse it, you get
2014 Jan 09 19:29 <mlehmk> 32373220202020203133382020202020333431202020202031333120202020203135310a333636202020202031393920202020203133302020202020333230202020202031380a32323620202020203234352020202020393120202020202032343520202020203232360a31382020202020203332302020202020313330202020202031393920202020203336360a31353120202020203133312020202020333431202020202031333820202020203237320

2014 Jan 09 19:32 <NiceLurk> or is that alsredy converted from hex>bin two times?
2014 Jan 09 19:33 <NiceLurk> becasue ttes was posting some longer string to wiki
2014 Jan 09 19:33 <mlehmk> I copied it from the place between the jpgs

2014 Jan 09 19:34 <NiceLurk> oh yeah -(hex2bin)  is included
2014 Jan 09 19:34 <mlehmk> ohh!
2014 Jan 09 19:34 <mlehmk> someone used xxd wrongly
2014 Jan 09 19:34 <NiceLurk> yes
2014 Jan 09 19:34 <NiceLurk> thats what i am asking
2014 Jan 09 19:34 <mlehmk> they turned bin2hex not the other way round
2014 Jan 09 19:34 <mlehmk> you take that hex-code from above
2014 Jan 09 19:34 <mlehmk> reverse it
2014 Jan 09 19:34 <NiceLurk> if i ude your string and http://home.paulschou.net/tools/xlate/
2014 Jan 09 19:34 <mlehmk> then hex2bin
2014 Jan 09 19:34 <mlehmk> you get the matrix
2014 Jan 09 19:35 <NiceLurk> i get perfect table
2014 Jan 09 19:35 <NiceLurk> using strings from wi iget partly right table
2014 Jan 09 19:35 <NiceLurk> and that long stirng it tottaly wrong and not necessarya at all
2014 Jan 09 19:36 <mlehmk> exactly
2014 Jan 09 19:36 <NiceLurk> can you fix that article , so that xdd will b e corect in it?
2014 Jan 09 19:36 <masso> fuck my hxd is the problem. doesn't let me copy anything from clipboard anymore...
2014 Jan 09 19:36 <mlehmk> I am not touching the wiki by changing anything
2014 Jan 09 19:36 <mlehmk> you can fix it
2014 Jan 09 19:36 <NiceLurk> also delete  from my xlate tutorial that you have to hex>text twice, since once is enough
2014 Jan 09 19:37 <NiceLurk> lel
2014 Jan 09 19:37 <NiceLurk> ok
2014 Jan 09 19:37 <NiceLurk> what i have to delete?
2014 Jan 09 19:37 <mlehmk> you shall not delete from wiki
2014 Jan 09 19:38 <NiceLurk> http://prntscr.com/2hwbq4  that needs to be deleted right?
2014 Jan 09 19:38 <mlehmk> that would need to be amended
2014 Jan 09 19:39 <NiceLurk> becasue this is text>hex insted of hex >tex
2014 Jan 09 19:39 <mlehmk> something happened wrongly there
2014 Jan 09 19:40 <mlehmk> yeah, I think you can remove 4 and fix 5
2014 Jan 09 19:41 <mlehmk> although we shall not delete from wiki
2014 Jan 09 19:41 <marcusw> no delete, only edit
2014 Jan 09 19:42 <NiceLurk> yeah  edit
2014 Jan 09 19:43 <NiceLurk> i mean fix what is wrong
2014 Jan 09 19:43 <mlehmk> yeah, but 4 is a totally wrong step
2014 Jan 09 19:43 <NiceLurk> but i dont know, i just see that it is not working in wiki
2014 Jan 09 19:43 <mlehmk> and should not have existed to begin with
2014 Jan 09 19:43 <NiceLurk> while with mlehmk obb string it works perfectly
2014 Jan 09 19:44 <NiceLurk> and i dont want to edit it since i have no idea what cmp and xxd is

2014 Jan 09 20:29 <mlehmk> okay, I'm creating a wordlist from the google books corpus American English
2014 Jan 09 20:30 <mlehmk> then I put it through my program calculating the gematrian sums to the words
2014 Jan 09 20:32 <mlehmk> anyways, getting some food
2014 Jan 09 20:56 <mlehmk> oh my, 4 million words list

2014 Jan 09 21:24 <mlehmk> They all have the gematrian sum of 1103

2014 Jan 09 21:43 <PersonalKilljoy> which time?
2014 Jan 09 21:43 <PersonalKilljoy> i mean approx time in hours from now?
2014 Jan 09 21:43 <PersonalKilljoy> 24? 12? 36?
2014 Jan 09 21:44 <iII|out> closer to 12, but I can check my logs when I'm home and tell you exactly when he logged off

2014 Jan 09 22:01 <masso> and surtri even spammed in here....
2014 Jan 09 22:02 <mlehmk> those numbers in the comments ... they tell us things with numbers
2014 Jan 09 22:02 <PersonalKilljoy> which comments?
2014 Jan 09 22:02 <mlehmk> in those trickle hex streams
2014 Jan 09 22:03 <mlehmk> first was <!--Patience is a virtue--> which later turned into <!--761-->
2014 Jan 09 22:03 <mlehmk> Gemmatria sum of patienceisavirtue is 761
2014 Jan 09 22:04 <mlehmk> and the current comment is <!--1033-->
2014 Jan 09 22:05 <mlehmk> classicallyinspired is 1033 for example
2014 Jan 09 22:05 <mlehmk> governmentestablished is 1033 too
2014 Jan 09 22:05 <mlehmk> policyadministration is 1033
2014 Jan 09 22:05 <PersonalKilljoy> i still think these primes are important
2014 Jan 09 22:06 <mlehmk> wavelengthmultiplexed is 1033, too
2014 Jan 09 22:06 <mlehmk> newharbingerpublications is 1033
2014 Jan 09 22:06 <mlehmk> discriminationreversal is 1033

2014 Jan 09 22:09 <masso> ^^this must be the solution lmao
2014 Jan 09 22:10 <mlehmk> Maybe I should calculate the gemmatrian sum over all 5grams
2014 Jan 09 22:11 <masso> mlehmk: sis you see this? http://codeseekah.com/cicada/count.html
2014 Jan 09 22:11 <mlehmk> though that's a lot of data to acquire first
2014 Jan 09 22:11 <masso> did*
2014 Jan 09 22:11 <mlehmk> Yes, I've seen this
2014 Jan 09 22:11 <mlehmk> have you seen https://www.dropbox.com/s/q11cv170a9bt722/sum.7z yet?
2014 Jan 09 22:16 <mlehmk> hehe
2014 Jan 09 22:16 <mlehmk> if cicada checks their logfiles they will find some funny words all being a sum of 1033
2014 Jan 09 22:20 <mlehmk> I think I should generate ngrams from literature cicada used yet
2014 Jan 09 22:20 <masso> <Rag_Na_rock> any thoughts why we never see .12p used in CICADA puzzles?
2014 Jan 09 22:20 <masso> <JustVisiting> Isn't it a font??

2014 Jan 09 22:23 <mlehmk> sup?
2014 Jan 09 22:26 <PersonalKilljoy> because it's not prime
2014 Jan 09 22:26 <PersonalKilljoy> :D
2014 Jan 09 22:39 <mlehmk> meh, the dataset I'd have to compute would be in the terabytes to get ngrams sorted by gemmatrian sum

2014 Jan 09 22:43 <PersonalKilljoy> it starts with 0d80 hex

2014 Jan 10 00:24 <brotherBox> Though my points stand, I was insulting to you and I want to apologize for that.
2014 Jan 10 00:26 <NiceLurk> no problem
2014 Jan 10 00:26 <NiceLurk> something great came out of it
2014 Jan 10 00:27 <NiceLurk> your point stand, but my inital palne was like last yaer
2014 Jan 10 00:27 <NiceLurk> have wik as dump
2014 Jan 10 00:27 <NiceLurk> put in all the things and backup links, so we can searh them later
2014 Jan 10 00:28 <brotherBox> I kind of came to the same insight when I was writing on "my version".
2014 Jan 10 00:28 <NiceLurk> so basicla dump, edited to the point that it is understandable, but i agree it looks terrible
2014 Jan 10 00:28 <NiceLurk> i talktd to albatron
2014 Jan 10 00:28 <NiceLurk> ke said he will make his own version
2014 Jan 10 00:28 <NiceLurk> taking from our wiki what he wants
2014 Jan 10 00:29 <NiceLurk> then when he will finish his  better leaner and shorted articles, we will put them in our wiki as in "abstract of puzzle" or smth like that
2014 Jan 10 00:30 <NiceLurk> probably best not to make albatrons version public, so that people dont start to sepatrete in two gropus and follow teo  wiks... better to just copy paste articles than to crosslink
2014 Jan 10 00:31 <NiceLurk> but i am not sure if albatron is gona do it or not, but i have good feeling
2014 Jan 10 00:32 <NiceLurk> last year wik was total clustefuck wit that archived menu not woth name menu until september, when countehash took some time and wrote that 4  "whts hspprnrd articles"

2014 Jan 10 00:44 <NiceLurk> this is my vewrion how winfags can get 5*5 from obb string
2014 Jan 10 00:44 <NiceLurk> shor and i thinng cute
2014 Jan 10 00:44 <NiceLurk> above it is unix version of same ting
2014 Jan 10 00:44 <NiceLurk> teefs made it
2014 Jan 10 00:45 <NiceLurk> but his version of strings he pasted doesn not convers to 5*5
2014 Jan 10 00:45 <NiceLurk> it has smone mistakes
2014 Jan 10 00:46 <brotherBox> I don't know. I didn't add this information and I did not even quite understand what happened there in the first place
2014 Jan 10 00:46 <iII> ok
2014 Jan 10 00:46 <NiceLurk> http://prntscr.com/2hzg7m i get this from teefs version
2014 Jan 10 00:46 <iII> it looks ok so far
2014 Jan 10 00:47 <iII> your looks mostly the same, isn't it?
2014 Jan 10 00:47 <NiceLurk> http://prntscr.com/2hzgk6  and this  from mine
2014 Jan 10 00:47 <NiceLurk> not the same
2014 Jan 10 00:48 <NiceLurk> in teefs version i just changed last pasta so it fits
2014 Jan 10 00:48 <iII> let me look at the hex in both for a minute
2014 Jan 10 00:48 <NiceLurk> but if you start to convert from:http://prntscr.com/2hzgxn    the it does not work
2014 Jan 10 00:49 <NiceLurk> not sure if that is only that unix/dos  line braking or something else
2014 Jan 10 00:50 <iII> that's honestly possible, as from a hex perspective, those two look identical other then formatting, at least in the hex
2014 Jan 10 00:50 * rr645 is now known as rr645-distracted
2014 Jan 10 00:50 <iII> let me go character by character
2014 Jan 10 00:50 <iII> and see
2014 Jan 10 00:51 <NiceLurk> try to recrete it from scratch, then compare
2014 Jan 10 00:51 <NiceLurk> this 24/7 shitt is hard
2014 Jan 10 00:52 <NiceLurk> ppl start to make mistakes after 72 hours of not sleeing
2014 Jan 10 00:52 <NiceLurk> even borgs
2014 Jan 10 00:52 <iII> the hex from those two are absolutely identical
2014 Jan 10 00:52 <iII> lol
2014 Jan 10 00:52 <iII> it has to be formatting or line endings or something, but I'd think xlate would be ok with those
2014 Jan 10 00:53 <iII> oh wait
2014 Jan 10 00:53 <iII> no
2014 Jan 10 00:53 <iII> the windows one

2014 Jan 10 00:54 <iII> where the unix one goes
2014 Jan 10 00:54 <iII> 323732202
2014 Jan 10 00:54 <iII> it's everything after that, that got messed up
2014 Jan 10 00:54 <NiceLurk> yup
2014 Jan 10 00:54 <iII> is your copy bad?
2014 Jan 10 00:54 <iII> looks like that's where it falls apart
2014 Jan 10 00:55 <NiceLurk> http://prntscr.com/2hwpj9 this is what i copied
2014 Jan 10 00:55 <NiceLurk> http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/CICADA_3301_2014_PUZZLE_FACTS_PART_3?file=Oob.jpg#This_is_string_from_between_two_jpgs.
2014 Jan 10 00:55 <NiceLurk> this is what soulseekah copied
2014 Jan 10 00:55 <iII> in what you copied it's correct
2014 Jan 10 00:55 <NiceLurk> it looks same to me
2014 Jan 10 00:55 <NiceLurk> if you follow my steps, you get correct 5*5 right
2014 Jan 10 00:56 <iII> yeah
2014 Jan 10 00:56 <iII> your steps should be fine
2014 Jan 10 00:56 <NiceLurk> i might leave out first byte
2014 Jan 10 00:56 <iII> and the last two screen shots are fine, just somehow the one in xlate is missing a number
2014 Jan 10 00:56 <NiceLurk> i left out 0x0A 0x0A
2014 Jan 10 00:57 <NiceLurk> and started with 66 fyte, tht looked correct to mee, all obb bytes are then just numbers,  mean assi
2014 Jan 10 00:58 <iII> it looks like soul's left it out too
2014 Jan 10 00:58 <NiceLurk> 0A is not ascii printable so i left it out
2014 Jan 10 00:58 <NiceLurk> cicada puts 0A few time s on end of jps also, iirc
2014 Jan 10 00:58 <iII> it's a line feed
2014 Jan 10 00:58 <iII> I think
2014 Jan 10 00:58 <iII> 0a
2014 Jan 10 00:59 <NiceLurk> i am sure i sw 0A during 2014 puzzle once before and we just  disregarded it
2014 Jan 10 00:59 <NiceLurk> yeah its line feed
2014 Jan 10 00:59 <iII> sorry, carriage return
2014 Jan 10 00:59 <NiceLurk> ot that
2014 Jan 10 00:59 <iII> w/e
2014 Jan 10 00:59 <NiceLurk> anyway nothing
2014 Jan 10 00:59 <iII> yeah
2014 Jan 10 00:59 <iII> sorry, brb
2014 Jan 10 01:00 <grazzab|zzz> morning
2014 Jan 10 01:00 * grazzab|zzz is now known as grazzab
2014 Jan 10 01:00 <NiceLurk> http://prntscr.com/2hzkj0  tihs is where mistake is
2014 Jan 10 01:00 <NiceLurk> this is alot longer that obb string
2014 Jan 10 01:01 <NiceLurk> i dont know why
2014 Jan 10 01:01 <NiceLurk> maybe he did xxd wrong or he just did mistake while pastin it to wiki
2014 Jan 10 01:01 <iII> yeah
2014 Jan 10 01:01 <iII> I think so
2014 Jan 10 01:01 <iII> as all the methods look perfect
2014 Jan 10 01:02 <NiceLurk> but i dont know xxd and cmp commands so i dont know where  he started to go the wrong way
2014 Jan 10 01:02 <NiceLurk> then just replace that asta with right one
2014 Jan 10 01:03 <NiceLurk> anyway, how long this shit has been unnoticed whows that 95% odnt  redo single step of puzzle :-)
2014 Jan 10 01:03 <NiceLurk> sometimes i wish we would have eash small title on separate page
2014 Jan 10 01:03 <NiceLurk> so each ne has its own comments
2014 Jan 10 01:03 <NiceLurk> where ppl can write and point out oticed mistakes
2014 Jan 10 01:04 <iII> that'd be awesome, but so much extra work
2014 Jan 10 01:04 <iII> and, it's really sad to me that people don't replicate the steps, they'd learn so much by doing it
2014 Jan 10 01:04 <NiceLurk> in this long ass articles comments are just lost, we got like thousands of them, sometimes it even might contan slution, and we can just miss it
2014 Jan 10 01:04 <iII> 300 of us and no one noticed the error lol
2014 Jan 10 01:04 <iII> yeah, that's a problem too
2014 Jan 10 01:05 <NiceLurk> columnar transposition was solved only in comments :-)
2014 Jan 10 01:05 <NiceLurk> thx to CW
2014 Jan 10 01:05 <iII> how long did we sit on the transposition lol
2014 Jan 10 01:05 <iII> yeah
2014 Jan 10 01:05 <NiceLurk> like 24 hours
2014 Jan 10 01:05 <iII> yeah
2014 Jan 10 01:05 <NiceLurk> too long for such sibple cipher,
2014 Jan 10 01:05 <NiceLurk> or maybe not
2014 Jan 10 01:06 <NiceLurk> looks like cW is experienced puzzler, based on how well he docummented solution in wiki
2014 Jan 10 01:06 <NiceLurk> links tables, procedure.. everything to show how you have to think to solve it
2014 Jan 10 01:07 <NiceLurk> NEXT
2014 Jan 10 01:07 <iII> makes me wonder why they aren't with us
2014 Jan 10 01:07 <NiceLurk> as i NEXT PROBLEM IN WIKI
2014 Jan 10 01:07 <NiceLurk> http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/CICADA_3301_2014_PUZZLE_FACTS_PART_3#ONION_3_ver_1_.3E_a_HTML_blank_page
2014 Jan 10 01:07 <NiceLurk> i put this in
2014 Jan 10 01:07 <iII> or they are, and don't want recognition
2014 Jan 10 01:08 <NiceLurk> when CW found solution onion was blank
2014 Jan 10 01:08 <NiceLurk> people under his comment begin to speuclate when side will update
2014 Jan 10 01:08 <iII> yeah, and it stayed that way for a bit
2014 Jan 10 01:08 <NiceLurk>     So the 00 20 35 time does that mean Midnight 20:35AM or PM, maybe this is the time we are supposed to log onto the site?
2014 Jan 10 01:08 <NiceLurk>     00 20 35 is a 24 hour clock so it will be 12:20:53 AM
2014 Jan 10 01:08 <NiceLurk>     follow whatever time the twitter is using
2014 Jan 10 01:08 <NiceLurk>     https://twitter.com/1231507051321
2014 Jan 10 01:08 <NiceLurk>     I have no idea where 00 20 35  came from
2014 Jan 10 01:08 <NiceLurk> ^^ ^last one is my question
2014 Jan 10 01:08 <iII> it's a false lead
2014 Jan 10 01:09 <iII> meaningless
2014 Jan 10 01:09 <NiceLurk> 00 20 35
2014 Jan 10 01:09 <NiceLurk> whaere the hell did that came from
2014 Jan 10 01:09 <iII> someone else got taht out of an unfinished transposition
2014 Jan 10 01:09 <NiceLurk> ok so it needs to be deleted
2014 Jan 10 01:09 <iII> they got "join by (that time) pm " etc, then a bunch of useless letters
2014 Jan 10 01:09 <NiceLurk> puzzle didnt contain any hint when onion wil start rigt!
2014 Jan 10 01:09 <NiceLurk> ?
2014 Jan 10 01:09 <iII> yeah, it's definately not legit
2014 Jan 10 01:09 <iII> right
2014 Jan 10 01:09 <NiceLurk> ok
2014 Jan 10 01:10 <NiceLurk> it seemed important when i was pasting it in
2014 Jan 10 01:10 <NiceLurk> ok solved then, deleting that whole thing
2014 Jan 10 01:10 <iII> yeah, everyone made a big deal of it yesterday without verifying where it came form
2014 Jan 10 01:10 <iII> yeah
2014 Jan 10 01:10 <NiceLurk> ALSO
2014 Jan 10 01:10 <NiceLurk> verifying
2014 Jan 10 01:10 <NiceLurk> we dont have single PGP on last two pages
2014 Jan 10 01:10 <NiceLurk> :-)
2014 Jan 10 01:10 <iII> it's true, and so, so worrying
2014 Jan 10 01:11 <NiceLurk> we could aeasily fake this all if we would really try
2014 Jan 10 01:11 <iII> I'm concerned that our CW made the onion we're now seeing
2014 Jan 10 01:11 <NiceLurk> nonoe eve asks where PGPs are
2014 Jan 10 01:11 <NiceLurk> i just dont have tme to do them
2014 Jan 10 01:11 <NiceLurk> i will, next thing
2014 Jan 10 01:11 <iII> we talked very briefly about it last night
2014 Jan 10 01:11 <iII> but, the rest of the puzzle fits their style thus far
2014 Jan 10 01:11 <iII> so hopefully it's fine
2014 Jan 10 01:12 <iII> if we get an outguess out of the newest jpg, it could be there
2014 Jan 10 01:15 <iII> any other issues?
2014 Jan 10 01:15 <iII> I'm actually really glad I can help
2014 Jan 10 01:16 <masso> <iII> I'm concerned that our CW made the onion we're now seeing
2014 Jan 10 01:16 <masso> hmm, but the solution to the column cipher is lwgit
2014 Jan 10 01:16 <iII> like I said, the rest fits
2014 Jan 10 01:16 <iII> so hopefully it's fine
2014 Jan 10 01:17 <grazzab> masso
2014 Jan 10 01:17 <grazzab> did you ever find out about #cicada
2014 Jan 10 01:18 <iII> I'm still with marcus that this jpg has keyed outguess, so with any luck if I figure that out, we'll have a pgp
2014 Jan 10 01:20 <masso> grazzab: nope, but I heard the chan is dead...
2014 Jan 10 01:20 <grazzab> kk
2014 Jan 10 01:21 <masso> iII: what picture? the server-status one?
2014 Jan 10 01:21 <iII> yeah
2014 Jan 10 01:22 <iII> I haven't got anything remotely useful out of it yet though
2014 Jan 10 01:22 <iII> just junk binary that doesn't seem to xor with anything etc
2014 Jan 10 01:24 <NiceLurk> grazzab:

2014 Jan 10 01:32 <iII> I can't remember what sage is going by now

2014 Jan 10 01:32 <NiceLurk> check cloush

2014 Jan 10 01:32 <iII> lol!
2014 Jan 10 01:33 <iII> I missed that puzzle
2014 Jan 10 01:33 <NiceLurk> best one so far
2014 Jan 10 01:33 <iII> I can never decide what I think of sage, and I'm sure that's exactly what he wants lol

2014 Jan 10 01:34 <NiceLurk> this is it
2014 Jan 10 01:34 <NiceLurk> hi is very good guy
2014 Jan 10 01:34 <NiceLurk> i think he just started on the wrong foot with virgil
2014 Jan 10 01:34 <NiceLurk> or he was drunk
2014 Jan 10 01:34 <grazzab> he did that?
2014 Jan 10 01:34 <grazzab> that was good :p
2014 Jan 10 01:34 <NiceLurk> or she was drunk
2014 Jan 10 01:35 <NiceLurk> wait we were all drunk that hight riht?
2014 Jan 10 01:35 <iII> I was definately drunk
2014 Jan 10 01:35 <NiceLurk> http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/Cicada_3301_4Chan_tracking
2014 Jan 10 01:35 <NiceLurk> he made also this
2014 Jan 10 01:35 <iII> oh, he did that?
2014 Jan 10 01:35 <iII> that thing was awesome
2014 Jan 10 01:35 <NiceLurk> yup
2014 Jan 10 01:35 <masso> iII: this is the image at the same setting that come up with the remarkable lighter dots on outguessed jpgs: http://prntscr.com/2hzsop
2014 Jan 10 01:36 <masso> so I guess we can say there is no outguess in it
2014 Jan 10 01:37 <NiceLurk> Some say that user  cluosh from IRC has  taken over Rorschachs onion from yesterday.   <this is what wiki says
2014 Jan 10 01:37 <iII> thanks masso. I thought the dots were just a possible byproduct of outguess, but they always show up?
2014 Jan 10 01:37 <NiceLurk> but cluosh did say in shannel publibly that he made Rorsahchs puzzle
2014 Jan 10 01:38 <masso> yes, the dots are in fact the data
2014 Jan 10 01:38 <NiceLurk> dots?
2014 Jan 10 01:38 <NiceLurk> also masso
2014 Jan 10 01:38 <masso> outguess changes colour values of some px
2014 Jan 10 01:38 <iII> ok, thanks!
2014 Jan 10 01:38 <grazzab> outguessed
2014 Jan 10 01:39 <NiceLurk> can you visaly, wiht photosohp, detect otuguess in Primus Libnre
2014 Jan 10 01:39 <NiceLurk> ?
2014 Jan 10 01:39 <NiceLurk> i cant
2014 Jan 10 01:39 <NiceLurk> i can see it on black jpgs as that not black squares
2014 Jan 10 01:39 <masso> I'll try, 1sec
2014 Jan 10 01:39 <NiceLurk> but on primis libre white part of picture look intact
2014 Jan 10 01:40 <iII> interesting
2014 Jan 10 01:40 <grazzab> huh
2014 Jan 10 01:40 <grazzab> so maybe there is outguess on the runes
2014 Jan 10 01:40 * Quits: rr645-distracted (~rr645@pool-100-1-180-112.nwrknj.fios.verizon.net) (Quit: Computer has gone to sleep.)
2014 Jan 10 01:48 <NiceLurk> masso:
2014 Jan 10 01:48 <NiceLurk> look at this
2014 Jan 10 01:48 <NiceLurk> http://prntscr.com/2hzy0s
2014 Jan 10 01:48 <NiceLurk> all cicadas outgueees images were easy to detct on calibrated monitor
2014 Jan 10 01:48 <NiceLurk> or with help of levels in photoshop
2014 Jan 10 01:49 <NiceLurk> but this yyears one is NOT
2014 Jan 10 01:49 <NiceLurk> does cicada use newver version of outgues?
2014 Jan 10 01:49 <NiceLurk> is cicada creator of outguess?
2014 Jan 10 01:49 <grazzab> interesting
2014 Jan 10 01:49 <NiceLurk> this years one has artefacts only around text
2014 Jan 10 01:49 <NiceLurk> more of them that usually
2014 Jan 10 01:50 <NiceLurk> and black background is intact
2014 Jan 10 01:53 <NiceLurk> http://prntscr.com/2hzzf2  this is where data is hidden i nliber primus
2014 Jan 10 01:56 <masso> NiceLurk: you can find some of the dots in liber.jpg, but forget about that
2014 Jan 10 01:56 <NiceLurk> http://prntscr.com/2i002i   same in chapter
2014 Jan 10 01:56 <masso> <masso> so I guess we can say there is no outguess in it
2014 Jan 10 01:56 <masso> ^^^^^^^^^^and forget about that
2014 Jan 10 01:56 <NiceLurk> masso: around text right?
2014 Jan 10 01:56 <masso> http://prntscr.com/2hzzp5
2014 Jan 10 01:56 <NiceLurk> or in white space?
2014 Jan 10 01:56 <masso> most likely there is outguess in the server pic
2014 Jan 10 01:56 <NiceLurk> yeah
2014 Jan 10 01:57 <NiceLurk> now  solve this http://prntscr.com/2hzy0s
2014 Jan 10 01:57 <masso> it's because there is i fact way more black (the runes) in it
2014 Jan 10 01:57 <NiceLurk> wha this yers start jpg doesnt have that  suares all over the black background?
2014 Jan 10 01:58 <masso> and outguess usually lowers only black values, but doesn't increase pure white px
2014 Jan 10 01:58 <NiceLurk> ann every single outguees of black backgrounf white text i ahave seen until jan 6 2014 had that squares
2014 Jan 10 01:58 <masso> the complete data can be stored in the black values of the runes, in liber there is not enough black, so the rest gets stored in white
2014 Jan 10 01:59 <masso> look at the runes. even the same ones have different pixelation, mean it most likely is not from compression or something
2014 Jan 10 02:00 <NiceLurk> yoe are right
2014 Jan 10 02:00 <masso> iII: ^^^^
2014 Jan 10 02:01 <NiceLurk> and this years outguess has black background intact becasue they have relatively  light picture of cicada in it and all data can be stored in ext an d in cicada pic
2014 Jan 10 02:01 <NiceLurk> so no need to fuck up with pure black
2014 Jan 10 02:01 <masso> can someone try the first short onion stream as keyfile on the pic pls?
2014 Jan 10 02:02 <masso> iII: ^^
2014 Jan 10 02:02 <NiceLurk> if anyone interested, here you can see how outguees hides data in black and in white past of text http://prntscr.com/2i01qd
2014 Jan 10 02:07 <masso> NiceLurk: ya, I did a lot of things with outguess. It decreases the rgb values of px by max 1 for R and B, 2 for G
2014 Jan 10 02:09 <iII> shit just got back, there can be data?
2014 Jan 10 02:09 <masso> ya, most likely there is actually data
2014 Jan 10 02:10 <masso> it's because there is more black in it and outguess oesn'T need to change white values
2014 Jan 10 02:10 <iII> that makes sense
2014 Jan 10 02:10 <iII> all the last years were nearly all black
2014 Jan 10 02:11 <masso> in liber.jpg there is not enough black, so it uses the white too
2014 Jan 10 02:11 <iII> yeah
2014 Jan 10 02:11 <masso> see my last screenshot^^
2014 Jan 10 02:11 <masso> same runes should have same pixelation
2014 Jan 10 02:12 <masso> but they haven't, so this is where outguess stores the data
2014 Jan 10 02:13 <iII> that's awesome
2014 Jan 10 02:13 <iII> so, I should go back to trying to find a key
2014 Jan 10 02:14 <masso> iII: try the string from the server as a keyfile pls
2014 Jan 10 02:15 <iII> sure
2014 Jan 10 02:15 <iII> the short string from onion2?
2014 Jan 10 02:15 <iII> the growing one?
2014 Jan 10 02:15 <masso> yes, the 1st growing one
2014 Jan 10 02:16 <iII> Extracted datalen is too long: 58381 > 47198
2014 Jan 10 02:16 <masso> backwards?
2014 Jan 10 02:16 <iII> iii@ubuntu:~$ outguess -r -k 1033 serverstatus.jpg testReading serverstatus.jpg....

2014 Jan 10 02:16 <iII> 1033 works but I haven't found anything that works with the output yet, so it could be garbage
2014 Jan 10 02:18 <iII> backwards works too
2014 Jan 10 02:18 <iII> once again, just binary, I'll look at it though
2014 Jan 10 02:18 <masso> ya, the thing is, even a wrong password/keyfile most likely comes up with data
2014 Jan 10 02:19 <iII> that is the problem yes
2014 Jan 10 02:20 <masso> btw, sorry, I'm of no big help with this atm, I'm rendering something on my pc atm...
2014 Jan 10 02:20 <iII> no worries, you verified it's possible

2014 Jan 10 02:25 <masso> should we tell solvers? maybe they can try it too...
2014 Jan 10 02:26 <iII> yeah, no reason not to I think

2014 Jan 10 03:48 <NiceLurk> mlehmk: what is this
2014 Jan 10 03:48 <NiceLurk> files for dictionary attack
2014 Jan 10 03:48 <mlehmk> for example
2014 Jan 10 03:48 <NiceLurk> or results from dictionary attack?
2014 Jan 10 03:49 <mlehmk> nope, it's wordlists categorized
2014 Jan 10 03:49 <mlehmk> category is gematria
2014 Jan 10 03:49 <mlehmk> ex. file 151.txt contains all the words where gematria sums up to 151
2014 Jan 10 03:49 <mlehmk> one problem is the letter "q" which I translated to "cw"
2014 Jan 10 03:50 <mlehmk> giving q the value 32, but it could be 113 as well, extending the gematria
2014 Jan 10 03:51 <NiceLurk> yup
2014 Jan 10 03:51 <NiceLurk> i hace same problems
2014 Jan 10 03:51 <NiceLurk> so you cant use any automatic cryptogram solver
2014 Jan 10 03:51 <NiceLurk> well done cicda, well done
2014 Jan 10 03:51 <NiceLurk> you bastards
2014 Jan 10 03:52 <mlehmk> I would just need a shell where I can use an unknown amount of traffic somewhere from 1TB to 10TB or something
2014 Jan 10 03:52 <mlehmk> then I could compile ngrams for gematria sums up to 5grams
2014 Jan 10 03:55 <mlehmk> I'm looking forward to do that, like a search engine for ngrams
