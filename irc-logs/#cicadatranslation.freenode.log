2014 Jan 12 01:56 * Now talking in #cicadatranslation
2014 Jan 12 01:56 * Topic is 'Full Runes: http://pastebin.com/PrzBzjvi'
2014 Jan 12 01:56 * Set by SheCalledMePaul!~SheCalled@69.177.224.118 on Sun Jan 12 01:44:47
2014 Jan 12 01:56 <JustExcited> cydoniac, so are the separated chars 3+rune
2014 Jan 12 01:56 * Joins: per346 (5b424c37@gateway/web/freenode/ip.91.66.76.55)
2014 Jan 12 01:56 <mlehmk3> anyways, there are 29 runes, there is no ROT with odd count of symbols
2014 Jan 12 01:56 <cydoniac> is an onion 15 chars though?
2014 Jan 12 01:56 <JustExcited> cydoniac, this is what I was talking about.
2014 Jan 12 01:56 <JustExcited> cydoniac, 16.
2014 Jan 12 01:56 <cydoniac> ONIO?
2014 Jan 12 01:56 <JustExcited> BUT runes can be double char.
2014 Jan 12 01:56 <cydoniac> yeah but
2014 Jan 12 01:56 <JustExcited> You have TH, IA/IO NG/ING
2014 Jan 12 01:56 * Joins: dead (~dead@unaffiliated/dead)
2014 Jan 12 01:57 <JustExcited> So "IO" could be a rune.
2014 Jan 12 01:57 <JustExcited> onIOn.
2014 Jan 12 01:57 <cydoniac> wouldn't the ns look the same?
2014 Jan 12 01:57 <Ymgve> so you are guessing it's variable shift?
2014 Jan 12 01:57 <Ymgve> seems like too much structure for that to me
2014 Jan 12 01:57 <nykos__> one thought
2014 Jan 12 01:57 <cydoniac> they're 5 different letters... at the end
2014 Jan 12 01:57 <JustExcited> Ymgve, variable takes structure.
2014 Jan 12 01:57 <JustExcited> cydoniac, yes.
2014 Jan 12 01:57 * Quits: mlehmk (~mlehmk@p5B3B0F62.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
2014 Jan 12 01:57 <JustExcited> the space says that.
2014 Jan 12 01:58 <nykos__> but the could ommit a letter to defeat bruteforce again
2014 Jan 12 01:58 <cydoniac> but how could it be ONION when N repeats twice
2014 Jan 12 01:58 <JustExcited> But then again maybe the space is just because the rune after 3 is taller and narrower.
2014 Jan 12 01:58 <JustExcited> cydoniac, PROGRESSIVE shifting. 
2014 Jan 12 01:58 <per346> we definitly need a table with all possible combinations of the strings
2014 Jan 12 01:58 <JustExcited> One rune is shifted +1, the other +2, +3, so on.
2014 Jan 12 01:58 <cydoniac> But how on earth can we figure it out if it's progressive shifting...
2014 Jan 12 01:58 <per346> then we can try to shift
2014 Jan 12 01:58 <cydoniac> that sounds like a nightmare to work out
2014 Jan 12 01:58 <JustExcited> cydoniac, we can try to shift, and I am doing that together with MasterKey kind of as we speak.
2014 Jan 12 01:59 <JustExcited> cydoniac, your nightare comment would require a philosophical movie-type statement from me, but unfortunately I have none so I'll just shut up so I don't sound ridiculous. :) 
2014 Jan 12 01:59 <JustExcited> Something like "I long and... dream for nightmares". See, sounded crappy. :) 
2014 Jan 12 01:59 <mdzhb> hmm what about
2014 Jan 12 01:59 <mdzhb> 1) the magic square
2014 Jan 12 01:59 <per346> only assumption is so far, that last few chars will be ONIO or ONION
2014 Jan 12 01:59 <mdzhb> 2) crib -> SACRED?

2014 Jan 12 02:01 <cydoniac> Okay, look at page 2
2014 Jan 12 02:01 <cydoniac> the big red B

2014 Jan 12 02:02 <JustExcited> onecool?
2014 Jan 12 02:03 <cydoniac> Ah...think I might have done something...give me a moment...
2014 Jan 12 02:03 <dead> cydoniac: the frequency of the second rune is quite high and thus could be 'e'
2014 Jan 12 02:03 <dead> so that isn't such a bad assumption
2014 Jan 12 02:03 <cydoniac> Maybe end of page 2 is A Warning again
2014 Jan 12 02:03 * JustExcited is now known as JustVisiting
2014 Jan 12 02:03 <cydoniac> just like the first runes
2014 Jan 12 02:04 <mdzhb> SACRED ending a line is a decent guess as well
2014 Jan 12 02:04 <mdzhb> both previous messages contained a line ending on SACRED, the square one even twice
2014 Jan 12 02:04 <cydoniac> yes - I really think we should use the previous runes as a good guide

2014 Jan 12 02:04 <JustVisiting> One side we do Outguess, one side book pages. :) 
2014 Jan 12 02:04 <mlehmk3> typing that rune text there is a strong distribution of runes
2014 Jan 12 02:04 <cydoniac> argh too many subchannels
2014 Jan 12 02:04 <mlehmk3> some are very common and others are rare

2014 Jan 12 02:05 * Joins: mc_teo (~user@unaffiliated/mcteo)
2014 Jan 12 02:05 <mlehmk3> for example the H one is only once on the first page
2014 Jan 12 02:05 <JustVisiting> It's just me, MasterKey and per346 doing outguess, right?
2014 Jan 12 02:05 <mlehmk3> EA and EO are very common
2014 Jan 12 02:05 <cydoniac> no, end of page 2 isn't a warning
2014 Jan 12 02:05 <cydoniac> You'd see a repeating rune
2014 Jan 12 02:05 <Xil> theres a one letter word on the second page
2014 Jan 12 02:06 <Xil> 1st line after the red bit
2014 Jan 12 02:06 <mlehmk3> onion would be 4 runes
2014 Jan 12 02:06 <Xil> only ones in english are a and i
2014 Jan 12 02:06 <mdzhb> presumably an 'a'
2014 Jan 12 02:06 <JustVisiting> OK, this is confusing.
2014 Jan 12 02:06 <Xil> exactly, its likely to be an a
2014 Jan 12 02:06 <JustVisiting> :)
2014 Jan 12 02:06 <cydoniac> red bit isn't a warning I don't think anyway
2014 Jan 12 02:06 <per346> no outguessing here atm
2014 Jan 12 02:06 <MasterKey> onecool: do you have your runes <-> english file ?
2014 Jan 12 02:06 <faleur_to_sleep> Xil - i see 2
2014 Jan 12 02:07 <SheCalledMePaul> masso posted somethingi nteresting on #cicadasolvers 
2014 Jan 12 02:07 <Xil> even better
2014 Jan 12 02:07 <faleur_to_sleep> an 'R' and an 'X_over_X'
2014 Jan 12 02:07 * Joins: cmeinco (~cmeinco@c-24-13-166-18.hsd1.il.comcast.net)
2014 Jan 12 02:07 <JustVisiting> I'll be in #3301magicsq for outguess. I know it has a different name, but it's already made for the magic square.
2014 Jan 12 02:07 <Xil> cause thats probably an 'a' too
2014 Jan 12 02:07 <cydoniac> I don't think it could be 'I'. They don't ever refer to themselves.
2014 Jan 12 02:07 <faleur_to_sleep> i've been working on one being an a and the other an i ... but the frequencies don't seem to line up
2014 Jan 12 02:07 <JustVisiting> It's a book page. Perhaps IN the book someone refers to himself.
2014 Jan 12 02:08 <cydoniac> 'let the text guide you' just keep it in mind
2014 Jan 12 02:08 <cydoniac> so I think the previous structure of messages will help
2014 Jan 12 02:08 <Xil> no, its definitely not a straight caesar
2014 Jan 12 02:09 <Xil> i think they're both 'A'
2014 Jan 12 02:09 <Xil> 22 runes apart
2014 Jan 12 02:09 <JustVisiting> What you could do is check the structure of the book pages against previous messages!
2014 Jan 12 02:09 <JustVisiting> Previous ENGLISH letter messages.
2014 Jan 12 02:09 <Xil> shift from the 22nd rune to the 5th rune
2014 Jan 12 02:09 <mlehmk3> end rune combinations like ᛖᚫ cannot really exist

2014 Jan 12 02:10 <cydoniac> it's 29 runes though
2014 Jan 12 02:10 <mdzhb> and fill with digits?
2014 Jan 12 02:10 <mdzhb> thats what ive done

2014 Jan 12 02:10 <cydoniac> I think it's save to rule out 'x' 'q' and 'z' possibly
2014 Jan 12 02:11 <cydoniac> maybe not q
2014 Jan 12 02:11 <per346> someone update masso please, so he can explain his theory
2014 Jan 12 02:11 <mc_teo> the FF at the end of line 3
2014 Jan 12 02:11 <cydoniac> z, x and j maybe
2014 Jan 12 02:11 <onecool> http://imgur.com/a/a0Phq is what i transcribed for the outguessed image
2014 Jan 12 02:11 <mc_teo> what could it be, if it was a simple substitution cipher
2014 Jan 12 02:11 <onecool> so i'll put that into the transpose cipher and play with it
2014 Jan 12 02:12 <cydoniac> Are you replacing numbers?
2014 Jan 12 02:12 <mc_teo> therefore, it has to be transposition, or polyalphabetic

2014 Jan 12 02:14 <onecool> if you look at the options; there are 3 runes with 2 possible transcriptions(ing/ng, ing/ng, ia/io)

2014 Jan 12 02:14 <JustVisiting> :) 
2014 Jan 12 02:14 <JustVisiting> But I write nicer. Once a year when I do that is. :)) 
2014 Jan 12 02:14 <masso> I don't think it's polyalphabetic. We's need a clearteyt for that...
2014 Jan 12 02:14 <masso> we'd*
2014 Jan 12 02:15 <per346> onecool: lol, nice!
2014 Jan 12 02:15 <cydoniac> mlehmk did you write it all out in the end?
2014 Jan 12 02:16 <per346> so we have OFIO at he end atm, any ideas on that, like shifting ...
2014 Jan 12 02:17 <JustVisiting> That cannot be correct.
2014 Jan 12 02:17 <onecool> cydoniac i'm not replacing numbers; i just wrote the corresponding letter/rune down for reference
2014 Jan 12 02:17 <JustVisiting> For an onion.
2014 Jan 12 02:17 <JustVisiting> TOO many chars.
2014 Jan 12 02:17 <cydoniac> was the hint 'text' or 'texts'?
2014 Jan 12 02:18 <per346> onion ist 16 or 17 long

2014 Jan 12 02:20 <cydoniac> The runes have been misleading
2014 Jan 12 02:20 <cydoniac> but there's a way
2014 Jan 12 02:21 * Joins: mlehmk3 (~mlehmk@p5B3B09DB.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
2014 Jan 12 02:21 <per346> ok, lets get back a little, there are some numbers in this outguess, rest is runes. any ideas on this?
2014 Jan 12 02:21 <counterhash> If you guys want a clue, you should really be checking the second paragraph in the second image, that begins with the 'B' rune
2014 Jan 12 02:22 <counterhash> You should be solving the runes first, then the outguess
2014 Jan 12 02:22 <JustVisiting> counterhash, but what if it's shifted?
2014 Jan 12 02:22 <counterhash> JustVisiting: I haven't finished with my clue yet
2014 Jan 12 02:22 <counterhash> Perhaps in that paragraph you will find a single character rune?
2014 Jan 12 02:22 <counterhash> Or two?
2014 Jan 12 02:22 <counterhash> Remember that 3301 have never used the word 'I'
2014 Jan 12 02:22 <cydoniac> is there additional outguess? As in more hex etc?
2014 Jan 12 02:22 <cydoniac> 3301 will never refer to themselves
2014 Jan 12 02:23 <JustVisiting> Uh-huh.
2014 Jan 12 02:23 <counterhash> So by logical conclusions, these single character runes would be 'A'?
2014 Jan 12 02:23 <counterhash> And we should use their positions to help determine how this cipher works?

2014 Jan 12 02:25 <per346> my point is: you can make an onion without numbers. if we assume this is an onion, and they make it with numbers, this is clearly a hint that this is an onion
2014 Jan 12 02:26 <per346> and not an OFIO, lele
2014 Jan 12 02:26 <per346> lol* :)

2014 Jan 12 02:43 <mdzhb> mlehmk1: so? if its neither, then what is it? because 2-letter words consisting of the same character pretty much prove its not monoalphabetic
2014 Jan 12 02:44 <JustVisiting> mdzhb, again I say: It can be LL, as in "you'LL'.
2014 Jan 12 02:44 <JustVisiting> Or "They'LL" since we have a TH rune.
2014 Jan 12 02:44 <JustVisiting> And it's three runes there.
2014 Jan 12 02:45 <mdzhb> well, then there are 4 different single-character occurences
2014 Jan 12 02:45 <JustVisiting> It can be different shifting by string.
2014 Jan 12 02:45 <mdzhb> and they can only reasonably be 'i' or 'a'

2014 Jan 12 02:46 <JustVisiting> mdzhb, we can have every * as a stop and a new string-shifting after that.
2014 Jan 12 02:46 <Eve4> On what do we work, forward, backward or both? Do we want to assume both images use the same code?

2014 Jan 12 02:46 <JustVisiting> Eve4, I say we should.

2014 Jan 12 03:31 <Surtri> I don't mind asking tbh
2014 Jan 12 03:32 <JustVisiting> xiridium, do you really think what I say makes sense?
2014 Jan 12 03:32 <JustVisiting> Oh, lol.
2014 Jan 12 03:32 <galligaskins> there's a word at the end of the third line of the forward .jpg that is just two of the same rune, i.e. FF
2014 Jan 12 03:32 <galligaskins> i can't think of a way to make a word out of that
2014 Jan 12 03:32 <cydoniac> yeah
2014 Jan 12 03:32 <cydoniac> So perhaps...
2014 Jan 12 03:33 <cydoniac> we got the english right but it's an encrypted message?
2014 Jan 12 03:33 <cydoniac> then of course we have the same issue as before
2014 Jan 12 03:33 <cydoniac> the IA/IO and NG/ING problem
2014 Jan 12 03:33 <Jase820_> how do we know we have the english?
2014 Jan 12 03:34 <cydoniac> http://snag.gy/yRk6U.jpg
2014 Jan 12 03:34 <cydoniac> someone posted this in solvers
2014 Jan 12 03:34 <galligaskins> I still think it's a simple monoalphabetic substitution because otherwise we'd need a key for all the rune pages and I don't know where we'd get that
2014 Jan 12 03:34 <cydoniac> that distribution is strange as
2014 Jan 12 03:34 <galligaskins> ok if that's the distribution then i'm thinking i'm wrong
2014 Jan 12 03:35 <per346> cydoniac: we need a flipped version added and it will be random. :)
2014 Jan 12 03:35 <cydoniac> did we get all possible outguess data?
2014 Jan 12 03:35 <Eve4> http://pastebin.com/NXDE0r0c
2014 Jan 12 03:36 <Jase820_> the distribution will always be strange with this.  for instance, not all uses of 'e' will actually be accounted for in the 'e' rune
2014 Jan 12 03:36 <cydoniac> are there no extra clues or anything in the dump?

2014 Jan 12 03:37 <galligaskins> cydoniac where did the let the text guide you clue come from
2014 Jan 12 03:37 <cydoniac> it's like, linear
2014 Jan 12 03:37 <Jase820_> that's why i wrote my script to change to single characters

2014 Jan 12 03:46 <masso> but has not only text, but the hex for another pic in it

2014 Jan 12 03:47 <Jase820_> that's the cipher for the first page
2014 Jan 12 03:47 <Jase820_> it's basically just an abash key

2014 Jan 12 03:48 <dead> i think the outguess from the reversed pic
2014 Jan 12 03:49 <dead> needs a key
2014 Jan 12 03:49 <cydoniac> Do we have 100% everything of the data?

2014 Jan 12 03:50 <dead> maybe the 3rd pic which is thought to be an onion address, is the key to the outguess for the reversed pic
2014 Jan 12 03:51 <Jase820_> a FF byte doesn't really give us anything
2014 Jan 12 03:51 <masso> the onion address pic yes

2014 Jan 12 03:51 <cydoniac> people keep saying outguess key like a buzzword, but it's just not a thing that has been done.
2014 Jan 12 03:51 <MasterKey> If i recall correctly after the growing string ended there was a space and some bytes
2014 Jan 12 03:52 <dead> outguess requires a key in some cases

2014 Jan 12 03:52 <dead> its been used in this year too
2014 Jan 12 03:52 <cydoniac> But the first time entropy spoke he talked about the massive update right?
2014 Jan 12 03:52 <JustVisiting> Anyone attempted to concatenate yesterday's hex string from the onion to any of the files? 
2014 Jan 12 03:52 <dead> there is definitely some stego data in the reversed pic...the outguess (without a key) seems like garbage
2014 Jan 12 03:52 <dead> ive tried various keys, all produced similar garbage

2014 Jan 12 03:55 <zoanthal_> Let the text guide you.Good luck.3301
2014 Jan 12 03:56 <cydoniac> let the text guide us...
2014 Jan 12 03:56 <Eve4> One outguess.
2014 Jan 12 03:56 <Eve4> In the first/forward image.
2014 Jan 12 03:56 <JustVisiting> OK, thank you Eve4!
2014 Jan 12 03:56 <cydoniac> Have people outguessed everything yeah?
2014 Jan 12 03:56 <cydoniac> So there's no more data
2014 Jan 12 03:57 * Jase820_ is now known as Jase820_afk
2014 Jan 12 03:57 <onecool> can we outguess the outguess?
2014 Jan 12 03:57 <zoanthal_> hexdump of outguess from reverse JPG if anyone wants it, personally think it is false positive http://pastebin.com/rNZQGeyb
2014 Jan 12 03:57 <Eve4> Quite confident they tried the second/reversed, too. Not sure about the small one from the outguess form the first one. Waaahhhh outguess-ception!
2014 Jan 12 03:57 <Vexus> heres the top part of the second image (with the red at the bottom) http://pastebin.com/qt8pdNNC
2014 Jan 12 03:58 <cydoniac> thanks for that
2014 Jan 12 03:59 <cydoniac> see there's that problem again
2014 Jan 12 03:59 <cydoniac> 'p ux lcg cgstm'
2014 Jan 12 03:59 <cydoniac> how would that translate
2014 Jan 12 03:59 <Eve4> I go for a nightly 4 am walk to the gas station, grabing a pizza and a box of cigarettes.
2014 Jan 12 03:59 <cydoniac> ;)
2014 Jan 12 03:59 <echoreply> just don't put the cigs on the pizza ;)
2014 Jan 12 04:00 <zoanthal_> here's how we know it rotates.  29 runes, 26 letters.  Distro is that OE is only used once though
2014 Jan 12 04:00 <cydoniac> Oh damn, i totally didn't realise TH was a rune
2014 Jan 12 04:00 <cydoniac> this changes a lot.
2014 Jan 12 04:00 <zoanthal_> TH is used 14 times
2014 Jan 12 04:00 <cydoniac> so we need a two rune word that repeats a lot
2014 Jan 12 04:00 <zoanthal_> lowest distributions are OE (1), A(3), H(4)
2014 Jan 12 04:00 <onecool> to/go/an/
2014 Jan 12 04:00 <cydoniac> don't think  in letters, think in runes
2014 Jan 12 04:01 <JustVisiting> cydoniac, you HAVE to think letters, to get something out of this.
2014 Jan 12 04:01 <cydoniac> But if the runes are different now, letters will only confuse you.
2014 Jan 12 04:01 <JustVisiting> Gas station sells pizza? Where do you live, man? Paradise
2014 Jan 12 04:01 <cydoniac> Something that looks like "THE" will not be 3 letters anymore
2014 Jan 12 04:01 <cydoniac> it's not direct like that
2014 Jan 12 04:01 <cydoniac> ᛄᚫ appears twice

2014 Jan 12 04:03 <Vess> just a quick question.. why are we sure the letters have to be latin ?
2014 Jan 12 04:03 <zoanthal_> OE is also only used in last paragraph
2014 Jan 12 04:03 <JustVisiting> Vess, it looks Cyrillic to you too? :) 
2014 Jan 12 04:03 <JustVisiting> I doubt there's too many Farsi speakers here, so...probably latin.

2014 Jan 12 04:05 <cydoniac> columnar transposition would only work if we had even sequences
2014 Jan 12 04:05 <cydoniac> even mostly even would be ok
2014 Jan 12 04:05 <cydoniac> but not this
2014 Jan 12 04:05 <essen_> ᚠ
2014 Jan 12 04:05 <essen_> JUST TESTING
2014 Jan 12 04:05 <onecool> can anybody outguess the outguessed image?
2014 Jan 12 04:05 <essen_> can anyone see that rune
2014 Jan 12 04:05 <cydoniac> I see it
2014 Jan 12 04:05 <onecool> i think there's a password
2014 Jan 12 04:06 <cydoniac> yeah, is it possible to outguess the outguess?
2014 Jan 12 04:06 <Lurker69> thx guys
2014 Jan 12 04:06 <cydoniac> Probably nothing but...
2014 Jan 12 04:06 <zoanthal_> it's been outguessed
2014 Jan 12 04:06 <zoanthal_> nothing
2014 Jan 12 04:06 <onecool> did they supply a password?
2014 Jan 12 04:07 <godbert> I'm guessing the outguessed image will give a new onion address when you use the cipher used on the larger texts
2014 Jan 12 04:07 <onecool> 'Extracted datalen is too long: 7383 > 0' suggests a password is needed 
2014 Jan 12 04:07 <cydoniac> okay, I'm going to try the anglosaxon runes
2014 Jan 12 04:07 <cydoniac> seeing as they don't have double meanings
2014 Jan 12 04:07 <cydoniac> it's still roughly the same use
2014 Jan 12 04:08 <masso> <onecool> 'Extracted datalen is too long: 7383 > 0' suggests a password is needed 
2014 Jan 12 04:08 <masso> suggests nothing, cause it's the default error message even when there is no data in it
2014 Jan 12 04:08 <perebor> is this distribution for both of the new pages from onion3? http://snag.gy/yRk6U.jpg
2014 Jan 12 04:08 <essen_> ᛠ has to be s,t, or o
2014 Jan 12 04:08 <MasterKey> stupid question : from the onion's string how many image did we get ?

2014 Jan 12 04:10 <masso> MasterKey: the data on the onion page is 2 pics 
2014 Jan 12 04:10 <masso> the 3rd one comes from outguessing the 1st

2014 Jan 12 04:10 <MasterKey> damn
2014 Jan 12 04:10 <cydoniac> what's the jpg header again, ffd8?

2014 Jan 12 04:12 <masso> <MasterKey> but there are many JFIF headers
2014 Jan 12 04:12 <masso> forget about JFIF, I can build you a mp3 with JFIF in the header... hex  FF D8 is the magic number, FF D9 the EOF, nothing more
2014 Jan 12 04:12 <MasterKey> if you look at the very end of the onion string you can see that there is ffd8ff  maybe there is something to mirror
2014 Jan 12 04:12 <cydoniac> there must be a mistage though...
2014 Jan 12 04:12 <cydoniac> There are loads of ffd8's
2014 Jan 12 04:12 <cydoniac> like too may for it to have that many images

2014 Jan 12 04:27 <cydoniac> but it doesn't really solve the odd words
2014 Jan 12 04:27 <Vess> I am still wondering if this translates to english and not some other language that has a different grammar structure
2014 Jan 12 04:27 <cydoniac> It definitely isn't another language
2014 Jan 12 04:27 <mrnatbus12> is the rune language the same as the other one?
2014 Jan 12 04:27 <cydoniac> that would be really bizarre to do
2014 Jan 12 04:27 <essen_> there are two single letter runes, ᛝ and ᚱ
2014 Jan 12 04:27 <Jase820_> do we have the frequency on the other pages they've given us?
2014 Jan 12 04:27 <essen_> could be A and I
2014 Jan 12 04:27 <essen_> or A and B in the context
2014 Jan 12 04:27 <cydoniac> But they'd never say I
2014 Jan 12 04:28 <cydoniac> It could just as easily be all A or A/I
2014 Jan 12 04:28 <beef> could be any Roman numeral
2014 Jan 12 04:28 <Vexus> well converting it as HEX to ASCII didnt work
2014 Jan 12 04:28 <cydoniac> What's the deal with IA/IO by the way? Was that meaning given to us by 3301?

2014 Jan 12 04:37 <DominicReddit> Some decrypt the SHA1 Hash with the PGP Sig first
2014 Jan 12 04:38 <DominicReddit> then bruteforce it for SHA1
2014 Jan 12 04:38 <perebor> yeah I got nothing from testing monoalphabetic substitution
2014 Jan 12 04:38 <Lafolie> perebor: we have 2 big clues in here
2014 Jan 12 04:38 <cydoniac> I don't believe it's substitution anymore
2014 Jan 12 04:38 <Lafolie> 1: the FF. 2: there's a lone R. That could be an A
2014 Jan 12 04:38 <cydoniac> Did someone mention the message from 3301 was PGP signed?
2014 Jan 12 04:39 <DominicReddit> I did.
2014 Jan 12 04:39 <Lafolie> If we have R as an A, that could be a starting point for polyalphabet
2014 Jan 12 04:39 <DominicReddit> http://mdzhb.dmtr.ru/onion3/1.msg
2014 Jan 12 04:39 <DominicReddit> That was PGP signed.
2014 Jan 12 04:39 <MasterKey> DominicReddit: yeah so ?
2014 Jan 12 04:39 <cydoniac> Thank you
2014 Jan 12 04:39 <cydoniac> I never saw that
2014 Jan 12 04:39 <DominicReddit> The PGP sign for it is at the bottom.
2014 Jan 12 04:39 <DominicReddit> So you can't just crack it for SHA1 before you decrypt the PGP
2014 Jan 12 04:39 <cydoniac> What is that string with it?
2014 Jan 12 04:39 <perebor> the distribution of glyphs suggests it isn't semantically secure
2014 Jan 12 04:39 <cydoniac> looks like an image at start
2014 Jan 12 04:39 <perebor> right?
2014 Jan 12 04:39 <Lafolie> Yeah
2014 Jan 12 04:40 <Lafolie> There's no... continuity
2014 Jan 12 04:40 <per346> bye, good night and good luck!
2014 Jan 12 04:40 <Lafolie> I translated the forward image, http://hastebin.com/bogikojiho.txt
2014 Jan 12 04:40 <Lafolie> There's no structure at all, the only clues are the FF and R.
2014 Jan 12 04:40 <Eve4> gn8 per346!
2014 Jan 12 04:40 <cydoniac> Yep, we have that too, but it doesn't seem to make sense in that form
2014 Jan 12 04:40 <DominicReddit> I SEE
2014 Jan 12 04:41 <DominicReddit> You a anagram to decode it.
2014 Jan 12 04:41 <Lafolie> Oh, there's an YP and a PY too.
2014 Jan 12 04:41 <cydoniac> I don't think an anagram will work. It's too long
2014 Jan 12 04:41 <DominicReddit> Cryptowheel I mean :P
2014 Jan 12 04:41 <cydoniac> But about that message
2014 Jan 12 04:41 <DominicReddit> FF is a really easy thing to decode with a cryptowheel
2014 Jan 12 04:41 <cydoniac> Just to clarify
2014 Jan 12 04:41 <Lafolie> If it's ciphered, it'll be something like PURPLE.
2014 Jan 12 04:42 <cydoniac> After the 3301 message, what is that string? Looks like  a jpg at start. is that the onion link?
2014 Jan 12 04:42 <perebor> is there a transciption of the second page?
2014 Jan 12 04:42 <Lafolie> Yeah
2014 Jan 12 04:42 <dead> what are the facts we know about the cipher text thus far?
2014 Jan 12 04:43 <cydoniac> But guys, you forget another problem with just translating it to english and ciphering. There are NGs that may be INGs, Cs that may be Ks
2014 Jan 12 04:43 <DominicReddit> The clues are FF and R
2014 Jan 12 04:43 <perebor> that linear distribution of glyphs that someone posted wouldn't suggest PURPLE though, right?
2014 Jan 12 04:43 <cydoniac> AOs and Ios
2014 Jan 12 04:43 <Lafolie> http://pastebin.com/2JTMvjsR
2014 Jan 12 04:43 <dead> position is important? so 1 for 1 wont work but maybe some sort of rotating replacement or something
2014 Jan 12 04:43 <Lafolie> I think the reverse image runes follow on from the first.
2014 Jan 12 04:43 <Eve4> Maybe we should work backwards. If we stick with the assumption that http://i.imgur.com/97YyfBk.jpg is a onion address and we are expected to figure out the algorithm from the other two images, we may be able to reduce the search space a bit. The algorithm must work in a way that allows us to reuse it for the inner image.
2014 Jan 12 04:43 <dead> yes they do
2014 Jan 12 04:43 <Lafolie> The first char is a line break, why else would it start with that?
2014 Jan 12 04:44 <cydoniac> the 16 dot symbol is a line break

2014 Jan 12 04:49 <cydoniac> Oh it definitely is

2014 Jan 12 04:49 <DominicReddit> Wait a second.
2014 Jan 12 04:49 <cydoniac> They know people would instantly try find the letters.
2014 Jan 12 04:49 <p799531> inner image might be a key
2014 Jan 12 04:50 <cydoniac> the inner image cannot be read properly

2014 Jan 12 04:50 <beef> p799531 I agree it might be a key
2014 Jan 12 04:50 <cydoniac> I don't think so
2014 Jan 12 04:50 <silence__> there are only 20 runes, the complete address would be 21, one rune is counting as 2 characters

2014 Jan 12 04:50 <DominicReddit> The inner image has no plain text with hex
2014 Jan 12 04:50 <p799531> problem is it contains several characters which are repeated not characteristic of a key
2014 Jan 12 04:51 <silence__> @cydoniac: do we have any guesses at the rest, any would be helpful?
2014 Jan 12 04:51 <cydoniac> they were right about everything being encrypted...
2014 Jan 12 04:51 <Eve4> [16 chars]onion => 21  chars, image has 20 chars. Would be enough if one of the runes represents two characters.
2014 Jan 12 04:52 <MasterKey> Eve4: there are more than one 1 think
2014 Jan 12 04:52 <p799531> or they live it as onio
2014 Jan 12 04:52 <perebor> I'm convinced we're to find the key to break the inner jpg from attacking the 2 pages of cipher text

2014 Jan 12 04:52 <cydoniac> really want that to be onion but it obv isn't
2014 Jan 12 04:52 <cydoniac> onion would probably only be 4 runes to start with

2014 Jan 12 04:52 <p799531> last onion from transposition cipher was .onio

2014 Jan 12 04:52 <cydoniac> you'd still see a repeated char

2014 Jan 12 04:54 <silence__> which runes do not repeat?
2014 Jan 12 04:54 <Eve4> They have 29 runes but only need 26, probably less because they there is no Q or X in the message. My guess is still that they equalized the frequency distribution by using some runes for two chars and using serveral runes for some high frequency chars.
2014 Jan 12 04:54 <Vexus> cock i forgot the 5 and 3

2014 Jan 12 04:54 <masso> there is no way to find the solution for the onion address because it has no cleartext. it's only possible when we break the rune texts first

2014 Jan 12 04:55 <Lafolie> I agree with masso. We've been given the 2 pages to translate in order to determine the new cipher.

2014 Jan 12 04:55 <Vexus> why?
2014 Jan 12 04:55 <Lafolie> From there we can recover the address from the inner image.
2014 Jan 12 04:55 <silence__> maybe they put the em and the m on top of each other?
2014 Jan 12 04:55 <MasterKey> well I ran all my computation on another translation
2014 Jan 12 04:56 <cydoniac> yep, it's definitely a new gematria.
2014 Jan 12 04:56 <MasterKey> maybe I will find something with that
2014 Jan 12 04:56 <cydoniac> and it's not easily determined by a computer because most programs assume one letter, not doubles/triples
2014 Jan 12 04:56 <cydoniac> i.e ING
2014 Jan 12 04:56 <silence__> If you stack the e rune and the m rune on top of oneanother they make the same rune
2014 Jan 12 04:56 <Lafolie> And on top of that there's the subject of the new text, we have no idea what the words mean yet.
2014 Jan 12 04:56 <Vexus> the small one comes out from Hex - base65 as

2014 Jan 12 04:56 <perebor> the gematria primus holds for the 5x5 matrix from yesterday tho
2014 Jan 12 04:56 <Vexus> doesnt the "==" mean something?
2014 Jan 12 04:57 <DominicReddit> That's base64
2014 Jan 12 04:57 <Lafolie> I noticed something about the 5x5, how come the middle columns has two different words at the top and bottom?

2014 Jan 12 04:57 <cydoniac> symmetrical
2014 Jan 12 04:57 <cydoniac> it's central symmetry around the middle number

2014 Jan 12 04:58 <perebor> Lafolie: both words total 130 gematrically
2014 Jan 12 04:58 <Lafolie> ah
2014 Jan 12 04:59 <Lafolie> And what of the byte stream from last night?
2014 Jan 12 04:59 <Eve4> We don't know/didn't use.
2014 Jan 12 04:59 <DominicReddit> Did anyone solve the 1.msg yet?
2014 Jan 12 04:59 <silence__> Did any one try adding and adding an e to one of the m's?
2014 Jan 12 04:59 <DominicReddit> AS ARE ISRE CRE RENW BXMD.
2014 Jan 12 05:00 <Eve4> 1.msg contains http://i.imgur.com/97YyfBk.jpg.
2014 Jan 12 05:00 <DominicReddit> I got that guessing using a cryptogram
2014 Jan 12 05:01 <silence__> We know they combined char because an onion url is 21 char long (16+5).  If you lay the m rune on top of the e ruin you get the same rune
2014 Jan 12 05:01 <Vexus> wait wait wait 
2014 Jan 12 05:01 <Vexus> how many runes are there?
2014 Jan 12 05:01 <cydoniac> 29
2014 Jan 12 05:01 <Vexus> did someone say 29?
2014 Jan 12 05:01 <Vexus> ok 
2014 Jan 12 05:01 <Vexus> the small code 
2014 Jan 12 05:01 <silence__> the m could be m,e, me, or me
2014 Jan 12 05:01 <cydoniac> some are combinations
2014 Jan 12 05:01 <Vexus> if you take all the letters they represent in latin 
2014 Jan 12 05:01 <cydoniac> ng/ing, ia/io, etc
2014 Jan 12 05:01 <DominicReddit> Anything on the inner image?
2014 Jan 12 05:01 <Vexus> and yse the 5 and 3 as th and u 
2014 Jan 12 05:01 <Vexus> theres 29 characters 
2014 Jan 12 05:02 <Vexus> thmdeofmarsuaeingringjeaeoiau
2014 Jan 12 05:02 <cydoniac> no, 3 and 5 are obviously numbers
2014 Jan 12 05:02 <DominicReddit> Did you try it as a onion?
2014 Jan 12 05:02 <Vexus> nope 
2014 Jan 12 05:02 <cydoniac> it's an obvious clue that it's an onion
2014 Jan 12 05:02 <cydoniac> but it's not possible to access the onion 
2014 Jan 12 05:02 <cydoniac> they gave us the url in plain sight but knowing the letters aren't clear at all
2014 Jan 12 05:02 <Vess> hmm isnt 5 and 3 and that would make 53 so S/Z ?
2014 Jan 12 05:03 <Vexus> theyre separate vess 
2014 Jan 12 05:03 <DominicReddit> Bye guys.
2014 Jan 12 05:03 <Vexus> 5 is the 9th and 3 is the last character 
2014 Jan 12 05:03 <cydoniac> 5 and 3 are obviously numbers in the url
2014 Jan 12 05:03 <Vess> i know theya are so what  . :) its the only 2 digits on that sting
2014 Jan 12 05:03 <cydoniac> it fits perfectly with the chars
2014 Jan 12 05:03 <MasterKey> Vexus: I checked your translation : there is no 91 value in the gematria
2014 Jan 12 05:04 <Vess> could mean 53 also .. which lead to S/Z rune but no diea if that is right or if that gives anything :)
2014 Jan 12 05:04 <Lafolie> The two pages of runes are what should be attacked
2014 Jan 12 05:04 <cydoniac> But then you have no onion
2014 Jan 12 05:04 <Vexus> oh cock 
2014 Jan 12 05:04 <Vexus> thanks for the heads up masterkey 
2014 Jan 12 05:04 <Lafolie> The inner will follow.
2014 Jan 12 05:04 <cydoniac> onions nearly always have at least one digit
2014 Jan 12 05:04 <Vexus> 97 ... sorry I have terrible handwriting that I can't even read sometimes 
2014 Jan 12 05:05 <MasterKey> that's allright =)
2014 Jan 12 05:05 <perebor> anyone have a transcription for the second page of runes? I was going to test n-gram substitutions/distributions
2014 Jan 12 05:05 <Vexus> yeah perebor im just typign it up

2014 Jan 12 05:11 <cydoniac> not this
2014 Jan 12 05:11 <cydoniac> the problem is, this graph doesn't count for special runes like oe, ae, i/ng, etc

2014 Jan 12 05:12 <cydoniac> The transciptions can't be accurate unless they have NG/ING instead of guessing one
2014 Jan 12 05:13 <cydoniac> then it's useless for any sort of substitution without a special program or using a number/symbol to account for that

2014 Jan 12 05:13 <Vess> is there a general consensus on what the dots mean. besides the bigger cluster ones that probably are end of sentences ..
2014 Jan 12 05:13 <Vess> ?
2014 Jan 12 05:13 <cydoniac> the other problem is there are very few words that don't have the special characters added on
2014 Jan 12 05:13 <cydoniac> big cluster is a line break I think.
2014 Jan 12 05:13 <cydoniac> 4 dots is a full stop I believe
2014 Jan 12 05:14 <nazgul> My transcription is here: http://pastebin.com/WkVMJZ12
2014 Jan 12 05:14 <Vess> big I mean 4 and above 
2014 Jan 12 05:14 <Vess> I am inetrested in the single dots ..
2014 Jan 12 05:14 <mig22> space
2014 Jan 12 05:14 <cydoniac> single dot means space
2014 Jan 12 05:14 <Vess> yes and that is wrong I think , single dots are not spaces
2014 Jan 12 05:14 <cydoniac> they are
2014 Jan 12 05:14 <Lafolie> cydoniac: based on the previous runes I thought it was 4 for break, 2 for stop, 1 for space. Cluster for colon/header
2014 Jan 12 05:15 <Lgx> could it be like onion 2?
2014 Jan 12 05:15 <cydoniac> I need to check an earlier rune to verify that
