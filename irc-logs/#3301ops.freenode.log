2013 Nov 27 09:32 <Ymgve> hi
2013 Nov 27 09:32 <counterhash> Cool.
2013 Nov 27 09:32 <counterhash> I think the others are afk atm, haven't heard back from absence in PM for a while
2013 Nov 27 09:32 <counterhash> Also did you recieve an email in 2012?
2013 Nov 27 09:33 <Ymgve> I was never involved in 2012
2013 Nov 27 09:33 <Ymgve> didn't hear about it until 2013
2013 Nov 27 09:33 <counterhash> Because I need one without the stripping of the GPG signature so I can verify it
2013 Nov 27 09:33 <counterhash> Cool
2013 Nov 27 10:00 <absence_> unlikely to find them
2013 Nov 27 10:00 <absence_> no one was ever found from within the group
2013 Nov 27 10:00 <absence_> @ ymgve you going to be here for the 2014 ones
2013 Nov 27 11:02 <Ymgve> guess so
2013 Nov 27 11:02 <Ymgve> tho I don't really believe there will be anything in 2014
2013 Nov 27 13:19 <iII|out> super delayed, but I agree with Ymgve. I'm suspecting nothing in 2014

2013 Nov 27 20:28 <absence_> Ymgve, why do u think that?
2013 Nov 27 20:29 <absence_> despite there not even being an official ending to 2013.
2013 Nov 27 20:36 <Ymgve> because there was no official ending
2013 Nov 27 20:36 <absence_> you think they'll invite the 2013 people bad?
2013 Nov 27 20:38 <Ymgve> bad?
2013 Nov 27 20:38 <absence_> back*
2013 Nov 27 20:39 <Ymgve> they didn't so far so I guess not
2013 Nov 27 20:40 <absence_> what was in your next response, Ymgve ?
2013 Nov 27 20:41 <absence_> for 3301 tcp servers
2013 Nov 27 20:41 <Ymgve> it was basically the same as the leaked 2012 recruitment mail
2013 Nov 27 20:42 <absence_> and how were u suppose to respond to it?
2013 Nov 27 20:42 <Ymgve> mail the same address that you sent the onion address to
2013 Nov 27 20:42 <absence_> Ah.
2013 Nov 27 20:42 <absence_> i never had any time to atually do the server \/
