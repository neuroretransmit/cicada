2014 Jan 06 18:39 <brotherBox> working on maelstrom
2014 Jan 06 18:39 <neferty> actually crap, does this log only to the console by default?
2014 Jan 06 18:39 <mdzhb> no
2014 Jan 06 18:39 <mdzhb> the tmpdir you specified
2014 Jan 06 18:39 <Ymgve> so what's a good distro to use
2014 Jan 06 18:40 <Ymgve> I got backtrack in a vm but assume that's not ideal
2014 Jan 06 18:40 <brotherBox> /tmp/cxx/cxx.logs
2014 Jan 06 18:40 <mdzhb> ^
2014 Jan 06 18:40 <neferty> ok cool
2014 Jan 06 18:40 * soulseekah sets mode: +o Ymgve
2014 Jan 06 18:40 <neferty> i'll put that online as well in a sec
2014 Jan 06 18:40 <soulseekah> Ymgve: client instructions in topic
2014 Jan 06 18:40 <soulseekah> lemme know if you need help
2014 Jan 06 18:40 <brotherBox> Hi Ymgve 
2014 Jan 06 18:40 <soulseekah> trebla: how is it going mate
2014 Jan 06 18:40 <eonn> hi Ymgve 
2014 Jan 06 18:40 <soulseekah> any news on the 1c00?
2014 Jan 06 18:40 <soulseekah> Ymgve: might be fine
2014 Jan 06 18:40 <soulseekah> as long as it has cmake, python2, libgmp
2014 Jan 06 18:40 <soulseekah> ubuntu probably works
2014 Jan 06 18:40 <trebla> it's now 615M in /tmp
2014 Jan 06 18:40 <brotherBox> Ymgve, anything really. I use Ubuntu
2014 Jan 06 18:40 <trebla> slowly growing
2014 Jan 06 18:40 <soulseekah> arch works definitely
2014 Jan 06 18:41 <mdzhb> i be right back
2014 Jan 06 18:41 <soulseekah> people are running unbuntu 12 too
2014 Jan 06 18:41 <neferty> for the record, my server is running with the exact same parameters as trebla's did, sans the path stuff of course
2014 Jan 06 18:41 <brotherBox> Can you give some spec info?

2014 Jan 06 18:41 <brotherBox> Actually nevermind
2014 Jan 06 18:41 <neferty> it's not the strongest thing ever, but it's a quadcore, with 2GB of ram and 4GB swap right now, and pleeeeeeeeeenty of disk space
2014 Jan 06 18:42 <neferty> and a gigabit pipe

2014 Jan 06 18:42 <soulseekah> An update for newcomers
2014 Jan 06 18:42 <soulseekah> We've factored some numbers already
2014 Jan 06 18:42 <neferty> but now you removed the link to the pastebin lol
2014 Jan 06 18:43 <trebla> the krylov has been running for 11 minutes now
2014 Jan 06 18:43 <soulseekah> and ready for a larger test with more cores
2014 Jan 06 18:43 <brotherBox> noo
2014 Jan 06 18:43 <soulseekah> on a 100-digit number

2014 Jan 06 18:43 <soulseekah> set up your clients
2014 Jan 06 18:43 <soulseekah> errr
2014 Jan 06 18:43 <soulseekah> yes
2014 Jan 06 18:43 <soulseekah> that
2014 Jan 06 18:43 <soulseekah> and message me if you need help
2014 Jan 06 18:43 <brotherBox> I am not sure if its better to ask in public
2014 Jan 06 18:43 <brotherBox> i.e., here
2014 Jan 06 18:43 <soulseekah> Two rules: 1. don't "make install" 2. don't use Python 3
2014 Jan 06 18:43 <soulseekah> pm me for help
2014 Jan 06 18:44 <Keeper> I keep getting the 404
2014 Jan 06 18:44 <brotherBox> Just wait.
2014 Jan 06 18:44 <Ymgve> python3 is required to build tho
2014 Jan 06 18:44 <soulseekah> Ymgve: probaly not
2014 Jan 06 18:44 <soulseekah> are you sure?
2014 Jan 06 18:44 <Keeper> I have a guy with a quad-core intel
2014 Jan 06 18:45 <Keeper> 2,40 GHz
2014 Jan 06 18:45 <soulseekah> cuz people wihout python3 have built it
2014 Jan 06 18:45 <trebla> yes, cmake aborts if it doesn't find python3
2014 Jan 06 18:45 <soulseekah> okay cool
2014 Jan 06 18:45 <brotherBox> It indeed requires python3
2014 Jan 06 18:45 <soulseekah> but don't run with python3
2014 Jan 06 18:45 <soulseekah> make with anything you like
2014 Jan 06 18:45 <soulseekah> run with python2
2014 Jan 06 18:45 <soulseekah> python3 makes the server crash
2014 Jan 06 18:45 <soulseekah> ..ops shouldn't have said that
2014 Jan 06 18:45 <brotherBox> Keeper, if you have resources to spare, then follow the instructions
2014 Jan 06 18:45 <brotherBox> seekah pls
2014 Jan 06 18:45 <soulseekah> inb4 trolls with python3
2014 Jan 06 18:45 <Ymgve> is it important taht it's 2.7
2014 Jan 06 18:45 <soulseekah> it's imporatnt that it's 2
2014 Jan 06 18:45 <brotherBox> 2.x
2014 Jan 06 18:45 <Keeper> I've allocated just 1 core for now
2014 Jan 06 18:45 <neferty> it has to be 2.6+ iirc
2014 Jan 06 18:46 <Keeper> but what I mean is that I can get more people to join
2014 Jan 06 18:46 <soulseekah> test and get back with results
2014 Jan 06 18:46 <soulseekah> we don't know the exact versions
2014 Jan 06 18:46 <soulseekah> since only 4-5 people here actually are running the client
2014 Jan 06 18:46 <soulseekah> so report back with oddities
2014 Jan 06 18:46 <trebla> Keeper: try against neferty:s server
2014 Jan 06 18:46 <soulseekah> trebla: any updates on the 100 digit one?
2014 Jan 06 18:46 <trebla> neferty: is it up?
2014 Jan 06 18:46 <trebla> soulseekah: it's stuck creating the matrices
2014 Jan 06 18:46 <soulseekah> shit
2014 Jan 06 18:46 <Keeper> Which is neferty's server?
2014 Jan 06 18:46 <soulseekah> diskspace?
2014 Jan 06 18:47 <soulseekah> neferty: are you doing a c100 as well?
2014 Jan 06 18:47 <brotherBox> Can we get a du -sh /tmp/cxx symlink on a server?
2014 Jan 06 18:47 <trebla> http://maelstrom.neferty.me:8001/

2014 Jan 06 18:47 <neferty> soulseekah: yeah
2014 Jan 06 18:47 <soulseekah> is it runnig already?
2014 Jan 06 18:47 <neferty> sure is
2014 Jan 06 18:47 <soulseekah> brotherBox: can you change the the server to neferty's one
2014 Jan 06 18:47 <neferty> a couple people are already on it
2014 Jan 06 18:47 <brotherBox> Look who's back
2014 Jan 06 18:47 <soulseekah> for further work?
2014 Jan 06 18:48 <neferty> and i am in on it with 8 cores as well, too
2014 Jan 06 18:48 <soulseekah> neferty: you have to run client N times per N cores

2014 Jan 06 18:49 <soulseekah> I'm running 12 across 2 machines
2014 Jan 06 18:49 <brotherBox> unravel_within, do you have any chance to let the client software run on your rendering farm?
2014 Jan 06 18:49 <neferty> the cadofactor server is humming alopng nicely
2014 Jan 06 18:49 <neferty> OKAY FACTOR BASE STARTING

2014 Jan 06 18:49 <brotherBox> soulseekah, maybe he has achieved something
2014 Jan 06 18:49 <unravel_within> Yes, if you can get me the source somehow
2014 Jan 06 18:49 <brotherBox> I don't fucking know lol

2014 Jan 06 18:52 <brotherBox> FUCK YES
2014 Jan 06 18:52 <soulseekah> am I the only one still working on trebla 's server?
2014 Jan 06 18:52 <brotherBox> Yes.

2014 Jan 06 18:52 <soulseekah> I'll run one client for you
2014 Jan 06 18:52 <soulseekah> just in case
2014 Jan 06 18:53 <soulseekah> how's it looking, trebla, buddy?
2014 Jan 06 18:53 <trebla> soulseekah: no, it's just waiting, run on neferty instead, that one needs calculations
2014 Jan 06 18:53 <soulseekah> okay
2014 Jan 06 18:53 <Ymgve> it stopped at uploading the work unit
2014 Jan 06 18:53 <soulseekah> I'll leave on client though
2014 Jan 06 18:53 <soulseekah> Ymgve: which server?
2014 Jan 06 18:54 <soulseekah> ocieania or maelstrom?
2014 Jan 06 18:54 <Ymgve> maelstrom
2014 Jan 06 18:54 <soulseekah> k
2014 Jan 06 18:54 <soulseekah> no more work for now?
2014 Jan 06 18:54 <trebla> run on maelstrom for now
2014 Jan 06 18:54 <trebla> it is faster
2014 Jan 06 18:54 <soulseekah> yes
2014 Jan 06 18:54 <soulseekah> Ymgve: wait a bit see if anything happens
2014 Jan 06 18:54 <soulseekah> maybe all work has been distributed already
2014 Jan 06 18:54 <soulseekah> how many pieces are we running guyse?
2014 Jan 06 18:55 <neferty> 8 here
2014 Jan 06 18:55 <brotherBox> 2 ;_;
2014 Jan 06 18:55 <Ymgve> but it took like 1 second so not sure if it calculated anything
2014 Jan 06 18:55 <neferty> ...
2014 Jan 06 18:55 <soulseekah> Ymgve: you should be getting many pieces
2014 Jan 06 18:55 <soulseekah> bit by bit
2014 Jan 06 18:56 <neferty> i think he might have the same problem as i did
2014 Jan 06 18:56 <neferty> Ymgve: did you use the setup script?
2014 Jan 06 18:56 <soulseekah> which is?
2014 Jan 06 18:56 <soulseekah> Ymgve: can you paste output log?
2014 Jan 06 18:56 <soulseekah> you might have skipped an error
2014 Jan 06 18:56 <soulseekah> look for erros
2014 Jan 06 18:56 <neferty> the worker quitting right away because lack of .so
2014 Jan 06 18:56 <soulseekah> yes yes
2014 Jan 06 18:56 <soulseekah> that's what I'm thinking
2014 Jan 06 18:56 <soulseekah> unpatched clients
2014 Jan 06 18:57 <neferty> some of my workers are having trouble, and server seems to be doing nothing

2014 Jan 06 18:58 <soulseekah> did someone connect with unpatched client?
2014 Jan 06 18:58 <neferty> yeah, so it's probably someone with a bad client
2014 Jan 06 18:58 <neferty> how would i know?
2014 Jan 06 18:58 * soulseekah looks at Ymgve

2014 Jan 06 18:58 <soulseekah> we'll figure it out
2014 Jan 06 18:58 <neferty> soulseekah: alright
2014 Jan 06 18:59 <soulseekah> no it seems fine
2014 Jan 06 18:59 <soulseekah> Ymgve: python --version please
2014 Jan 06 18:59 <soulseekah> python2 --version

2014 Jan 06 18:59 <soulseekah> looks fine
2014 Jan 06 18:59 <neferty> wait not now
2014 Jan 06 18:59 <soulseekah> anyone running 2.6.x?
2014 Jan 06 18:59 <soulseekah> could it have the same shit as 3.3?

2014 Jan 06 19:01 <soulseekah> Ymgve: sometimes it's dosing
2014 Jan 06 19:01 <soulseekah> Ymgve: because it's the builtin server
2014 Jan 06 19:01 <neferty> i thinkit was bnecause some client was blocking the server
2014 Jan 06 19:01 <Keeper> Should I get more cores to Neferty's server?

2014 Jan 06 19:03 <soulseekah> are the uploads large?
2014 Jan 06 19:03 <mdzhb> so, this is another attempt at c100?

2014 Jan 06 19:05 <brotherBox> Hi people. Follow the instructions in the topic
2014 Jan 06 19:05 <soulseekah> or maybe fix the server for more scalability
2014 Jan 06 19:05 <Ymgve> but will workunit size increase with 130?
2014 Jan 06 19:05 <soulseekah> also don't forget o run more clients
2014 Jan 06 19:05 <neferty> i can tell that it's for 100% sure not the server hardware being saturated, the server is doing fine
2014 Jan 06 19:05 <soulseekah> Ymgve: I sure hope so
2014 Jan 06 19:05 <soulseekah> so we can work longer
2014 Jan 06 19:05 <neferty> so it's the server software that has problems

2014 Jan 06 19:23 <mdzhb> trebla: yes, for c130 it'll hand out larger chunks
2014 Jan 06 19:23 <soulseekah> PM if you're running

2014 Jan 06 19:23 <soulseekah> no offtop please
2014 Jan 06 19:23 <mdzhb> i hope that's not going to be an issue uploading
2014 Jan 06 19:24 <soulseekah> and also
2014 Jan 06 19:24 <trebla> no, the files that are uploaded are pretty small
2014 Jan 06 19:24 <soulseekah> if you fucking PM me with "it doesn't work" I won't respond - provide logs
2014 Jan 06 19:25 <mdzhb> by the way
2014 Jan 06 19:25 <mdzhb> the server supports threading
2014 Jan 06 19:26 <soulseekah> great
2014 Jan 06 19:26 <mdzhb> server.threaded=1
2014 Jan 06 19:26 <mdzhb> i think
2014 Jan 06 19:26 <soulseekah> it's threaded tho
2014 Jan 06 19:26 <soulseekah> oh
2014 Jan 06 19:26 <soulseekah> so it's not threaded atm?
2014 Jan 06 19:27 * soulseekah changes topic to 'Use this instruction to set up your client: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=aRWzQCx8 | server: http://maelstrom.neferty.me:8001/ | PM @soulseekah for help'

2014 Jan 06 19:27 <soulseekah> neferty: can you confirm?
2014 Jan 06 19:27 <mdzhb> soulseekah: doesnt look like it
2014 Jan 06 19:27 <mdzhb> it prints during startup
2014 Jan 06 19:27 <soulseekah> hmm
2014 Jan 06 19:27 <soulseekah> okay we'll have to launch the real deal in threading then I guess
2014 Jan 06 19:27 <mdzhb> "Using threaded HTTPS server"
2014 Jan 06 19:27 <soulseekah> or run antoher c100 test?
2014 Jan 06 19:28 <soulseekah> I think we should run another c100 test afterwards

2014 Jan 06 19:35 <soulseekah> no work
2014 Jan 06 19:35 <trebla> wait, that's for 130 digits
2014 Jan 06 19:35 <soulseekah> trebla: you're running 130?
2014 Jan 06 19:35 <trebla> soulseekah: no, I was just preparing a parameter file for neferty 
2014 Jan 06 19:35 <neferty> yeah because it's doing singleton removal right now
2014 Jan 06 19:35 <brotherBox> Is the run for cicada N going?

2014 Jan 06 19:36 <soulseekah> eonn: welcome back

2014 Jan 06 19:36 <soulseekah> good
2014 Jan 06 19:36 <soulseekah> so now all cores wait
2014 Jan 06 19:36 <mdzhb> neferty: can i get a shell to tail the logs? :x
2014 Jan 06 19:36 <trebla> neferty: check htop when it starts with linear algebra
2014 Jan 06 19:36 <neferty> i just disabled the account i created earlier lol
2014 Jan 06 19:37 <soulseekah> mdzhb: I think we should be able to safely run c130 if all is fine with c10
2014 Jan 06 19:37 <neferty> mdzhb: is it good if i put it on the webserver instead?
2014 Jan 06 19:37 <neferty> i'm running it as my own user right now
2014 Jan 06 19:37 <mdzhb> hm, can't you make a separate user?
2014 Jan 06 19:38 <soulseekah> neferty you can trust mdzhb add his public key
2014 Jan 06 19:38 <soulseekah> to authorized_keys
2014 Jan 06 19:38 <neferty> mdzhb: well i can but i can only give you a symlink to the logfile, as i'm running the server as MY user
2014 Jan 06 19:38 <mdzhb> as long as it doesnt die thats okay
2014 Jan 06 19:38 <mdzhb> might make sense to run it as a separate user and make sure more than just you can restart it if needed
2014 Jan 06 19:39 <mdzhb> but its your box, sorry if i sound like im trying to root it (hah!)
2014 Jan 06 19:39 <neferty> yeah true, i was just doing it this way for the test
2014 Jan 06 19:39 <soulseekah> give him root
2014 Jan 06 19:39 <neferty> mdzhb: nah don't worry lol
2014 Jan 06 19:39 <soulseekah> neferty: !progress?
2014 Jan 06 19:39 <neferty> algebra started just now
2014 Jan 06 19:39 <soulseekah> good
2014 Jan 06 19:39 <trebla> \o/
2014 Jan 06 19:40 <soulseekah> seems like we're making it in an hour with 20 cores?
2014 Jan 06 19:40 <trebla> check htop
2014 Jan 06 19:40 <trebla> mdzhb: is there a limit to the number of clients in the params file?
2014 Jan 06 19:40 <mdzhb> dont think so
2014 Jan 06 19:40 <neferty> trebla: it's using some CPU but besides that it's ok
2014 Jan 06 19:40 <soulseekah> any timeout on fucked clients?
2014 Jan 06 19:40 <Reticuli1> I am not able to reach http://maelstrom.neferty.me:8001/
2014 Jan 06 19:40 <trebla> neferty: but is it only using one core?
2014 Jan 06 19:40 <soulseekah> Reticuli1: what's the error?
2014 Jan 06 19:41 <Reticuli1> 404
2014 Jan 06 19:41 <mdzhb> all the references to clients are in case the server launches them, i think
2014 Jan 06 19:41 <soulseekah> Reticuli1: READ THE FUCKING MESSAGE
2014 Jan 06 19:41 <soulseekah> Reticuli1: it says: NO WORK!
2014 Jan 06 19:41 <soulseekah> :)
2014 Jan 06 19:41 <soulseekah> and is exactly what it means
2014 Jan 06 19:41 <trebla> Reticuli1: you have to compile the client, see pastebin
2014 Jan 06 19:41 <soulseekah> 404 No Work

2014 Jan 06 19:41 <soulseekah> Seriously people - read the error
2014 Jan 06 19:41 <soulseekah> and patience
2014 Jan 06 19:42 <Ymgve> can still compile and get things ready tho
2014 Jan 06 19:42 <soulseekah> yes
2014 Jan 06 19:42 <Ymgve> if you get a 404 that means things are probably set up correctly
2014 Jan 06 19:42 <soulseekah> no no
2014 Jan 06 19:42 <soulseekah> 404 is no work available
2014 Jan 06 19:42 <soulseekah> all our clients are 404ing right now, amitie?
2014 Jan 06 19:43 <iII|out> yep, for no work available
2014 Jan 06 19:43 <eonn> roger.
2014 Jan 06 19:43 <VBFH> yes
2014 Jan 06 19:43 <soulseekah> right

2014 Jan 06 19:47 <soulseekah> can we start on c130?
2014 Jan 06 19:47 <brotherBox> We can try. Unravel isn't ready
2014 Jan 06 19:47 <soulseekah> everyone ready with their clients?

2014 Jan 06 19:48 <brotherBox> soulseekah, its more a circumvention of security
2014 Jan 06 19:48 <soulseekah> Was he able to up the network for his cluster?
2014 Jan 06 19:48 <soulseekah> oh
2014 Jan 06 19:48 <brotherBox> We're workign on it
2014 Jan 06 19:48 <Ymgve> neferty: did c100 finish?
2014 Jan 06 19:48 <soulseekah> L-: what's your status? You will be kicked soon.
2014 Jan 06 19:48 <neferty> not yet, still on algebra
2014 Jan 06 19:48 <soulseekah> ey: what's your status? You will be kicked soon.
2014 Jan 06 19:48 <trebla> it is not threaded so it will probably take some minutes more
2014 Jan 06 19:48 <neferty> i'm gonna rent a beefier server right now
2014 Jan 06 19:48 <ey> what
2014 Jan 06 19:48 <trebla> no, don't change again
2014 Jan 06 19:48 <soulseekah> ey: you factoring or?..
2014 Jan 06 19:49 <ey> no you can kick me
2014 Jan 06 19:49 * ey was kicked by soulseekah (ey)
2014 Jan 06 19:49 <soulseekah> neferty: don't get more cores though
2014 Jan 06 19:49 <Reticuli1> Alright I am setuped 
2014 Jan 06 19:49 <soulseekah> I don't think they're even being used by the server
2014 Jan 06 19:49 <soulseekah> Reticuli1: what's wrong?
2014 Jan 06 19:49 <trebla> soulseekah: activate threading first, i think only one core is used
2014 Jan 06 19:49 <Keeper> how about another server to take the rest of the cores?
2014 Jan 06 19:49 <trebla> i meant neferty 
2014 Jan 06 19:50 <trebla> Keeper: yes, it is possible to start two servers in parallel
2014 Jan 06 19:51 <neferty> you can start two servers but they're gonna do seperate works
2014 Jan 06 19:51 <neferty> you cannot have two servers working on the same thing in parallel
2014 Jan 06 19:51 <trebla> neferty: you can start the 130 on port 8001 and 100 on port 8002 or something

2014 Jan 06 19:51 <trebla> it is only the matrix generation that requires cpu on the server

2014 Jan 06 19:58 <soulseekah> These are people who got invited because they wanted to help
2014 Jan 06 19:58 <soulseekah> But have not yet asked me for help
2014 Jan 06 19:58 <soulseekah> or said that they're running anything
2014 Jan 06 19:59 <soulseekah> so they're getting chopped out of here, sorry 
2014 Jan 06 19:59 <brotherBox> I am inclined to agree
2014 Jan 06 19:59 <soulseekah> inabox: How are you doing?
2014 Jan 06 19:59 <soulseekah> Kerash: How are you doing on the client?

2014 Jan 06 20:00 <Kerash> Kali, so Debian.
2014 Jan 06 20:00 <neferty> okay it's just eating one core now lol
2014 Jan 06 20:00 <brotherBox> Just install cmake
2014 Jan 06 20:01 <brotherBox> From what I know, it requires not further configuration
2014 Jan 06 20:01 <brotherBox> *no
2014 Jan 06 20:01 <trebla> install cmake python3 libgmp-dev and build-essential
2014 Jan 06 20:01 <Kerash> I did install cmake just now. Didn't help, but I'm working on it.
2014 Jan 06 20:01 <trebla> that should be enough
2014 Jan 06 20:01 <trebla> but start it with python2
2014 Jan 06 20:01 <iII> I didn't need to change anything, just installed
2014 Jan 06 20:01 <trebla> when it's done

2014 Jan 06 20:11 <mdzhb> might help track broken clients
2014 Jan 06 20:11 <Keeper> why more cores when there is no work from some minutes now?
2014 Jan 06 20:12 <Ymgve> because the work will come soon
2014 Jan 06 20:12 <neferty> Keeper: because the real number will take considerably more time and cores

2014 Jan 06 20:12 <soulseekah> mdzhb: can you find out the options?

2014 Jan 06 20:12 <soulseekah> wil add it
2014 Jan 06 20:13 <mdzhb> might need to add a random suffix for multiple clients
2014 Jan 06 20:13 <mdzhb> not sure

2014 Jan 06 20:14 <mdzhb> the keepoldresult doesnt actually do anything it seems, you can drop that too
2014 Jan 06 20:14 <soulseekah> oh no
2014 Jan 06 20:14 <neferty> mdzhb: any idea where the perl scripts are called from?
2014 Jan 06 20:14 <soulseekah> why bother
2014 Jan 06 20:14 <trebla> mdzhb: wait, then you have to copy the binaries to download2 too
2014 Jan 06 20:14 <soulseekah> with workdir and dldir
2014 Jan 06 20:14 <soulseekah> it messes up shit

2014 Jan 06 20:14 <soulseekah> it's default
2014 Jan 06 20:14 <soulseekah> leave defaults please

2014 Jan 06 20:23 <soulseekah> the rest of us are legit
2014 Jan 06 20:24 <marcusw> soulseekah: done, what's exact command to run for client start?
2014 Jan 06 20:24 -soulseekah:#3301cado- launch client X times where X is the number of cores you have

2014 Jan 06 20:24 * homevillageness feels bad for not having to run multiple clients
2014 Jan 06 20:25 <soulseekah> 1 core?
2014 Jan 06 20:25 <homevillageness> yeah
2014 Jan 06 20:25 <soulseekah> no problem every core counts

2014 Jan 06 20:25 <soulseekah> no
2014 Jan 06 20:25 <soulseekah> it makes you lose the ability of running X clients
2014 Jan 06 20:25 <soulseekah> anyone else ready?
2014 Jan 06 20:26 <PersonalKilljoy> so no client id now?
2014 Jan 06 20:26 <soulseekah> xheiserx: You're getting kicked in 1 minute, buddy, sorry.

2014 Jan 06 20:28 <brotherBox> It just worked when I installed it from package manager.
2014 Jan 06 20:28 <marcusw> but yeah, I'd leave it
2014 Jan 06 20:28 <soulseekah> on ubuntu it's libgmp3-dev
2014 Jan 06 20:28 <HereticLocke> pierre': CentOS/RHEL?
2014 Jan 06 20:28 <soulseekah> on arch it's something else I think
2014 Jan 06 20:28 <pierre`> debian
2014 Jan 06 20:28 <PersonalKilljoy> on fedora it sits in gmp-dev
2014 Jan 06 20:28 * marcusw already had it on arch
2014 Jan 06 20:28 <iII> on arch it's just gmp
2014 Jan 06 20:28 <soulseekah> me too

2014 Jan 06 20:28 <brotherBox> >fedora
2014 Jan 06 20:29 <homevillageness> so do we need to wait with starting the client or not?
2014 Jan 06 20:29 <iII> >all about that arch
2014 Jan 06 20:29 <soulseekah> homevillageness: no start the client
2014 Jan 06 20:29 <PersonalKilljoy> come at me bro
2014 Jan 06 20:29 <marcusw> soulseekah: already had it master race
2014 Jan 06 20:29 <trebla> pierre`: on debian, install python3, libgmp-dev, cmake and build-essential
2014 Jan 06 20:29 <trebla> that's what i did on the vps server
2014 Jan 06 20:29 -soulseekah:#3301cado- You can start your clients. Start N clients, where N is the number of cores you have. 404 error = no work. Patience is a virtue. Thanks.

2014 Jan 06 20:30 <pierre`> sudo apt-get install python3 libgmp-dev cmake build-essential did the trick
2014 Jan 06 20:30 <soulseekah> great

2014 Jan 06 20:31 <neferty> soulseekah: i'm pulling up an EC2 instance now
2014 Jan 06 20:31 <soulseekah> neferty: okay
2014 Jan 06 20:31 <soulseekah> but no more tests
2014 Jan 06 20:32 <neferty> c3.xlarge so plenty of CPU 
2014 Jan 06 20:32 <soulseekah> let's do c130 now
2014 Jan 06 20:32 <neferty> okay
2014 Jan 06 20:32 <soulseekah> although I'd like c100 to finish

2014 Jan 06 20:35 <soulseekah> cuz I got spammed

2014 Jan 06 20:35 <mdzhb> ;)
2014 Jan 06 20:35 <soulseekah> why
2014 Jan 06 20:35 <soulseekah> t is thread
2014 Jan 06 20:35 <mdzhb> it runs 2 threads, doesnt it
2014 Jan 06 20:35 <soulseekah> right
2014 Jan 06 20:35 <soulseekah> threads != cores
2014 Jan 06 20:36 <brotherBox> ^
2014 Jan 06 20:36 <soulseekah> you can thread as much as you like on each core
2014 Jan 06 20:36 <brotherBox> And processes != threads
2014 Jan 06 20:36 <soulseekah> right
2014 Jan 06 20:36 <soulseekah> that's why we launch it N times
2014 Jan 06 20:36 <soulseekah> once for each core
2014 Jan 06 20:36 <soulseekah> and hope the CPU will play nice
2014 Jan 06 20:36 <marcusw> considering python, it would probably be good to do N, not N/2
2014 Jan 06 20:36 <brotherBox> Hops is what we all need.
2014 Jan 06 20:36 <neferty> mdzhb: it only uses port 8001 right?
2014 Jan 06 20:36 <mdzhb> well, 2 threads should be able to keep 2 cores occupied
2014 Jan 06 20:36 <mdzhb> yes
2014 Jan 06 20:37 <mdzhb> sans the uploading part
2014 Jan 06 20:37 <soulseekah> but the process is stuck to one core
2014 Jan 06 20:37 <neferty> what?
2014 Jan 06 20:37 <mdzhb> no
2014 Jan 06 20:37 <soulseekah> how come?
2014 Jan 06 20:37 <lvkm> it is stuck to one core
2014 Jan 06 20:37 <soulseekah> you htink it jumps from core to core?
2014 Jan 06 20:37 <Keeper> So when are we starting c130s?

2014 Jan 06 20:38 <Keeper> it's late and i got school tomorrow that's why I ask
2014 Jan 06 20:38 <lvkm> because threads share their cpu cache

2014 Jan 06 20:49 <soulseekah> how long did the c100 take?

2014 Jan 06 20:50 <brotherBox> Wow
2014 Jan 06 20:50 <soulseekah> anyone looks at logs?

2014 Jan 06 20:50 <cheetahburn> any estimation how long the whole process will take?
2014 Jan 06 20:50 <soulseekah> cheetahburn: no idea how it scales, bro
2014 Jan 06 20:50 <soulseekah> but not linearly def.
2014 Jan 06 20:50 <trebla> neferty: I updated the script at http://piratepad.net/c130 a bit
2014 Jan 06 20:50 <soulseekah> 90 minutes
2014 Jan 06 20:50 <eonn> AND now we have more cpu power
2014 Jan 06 20:51 <soulseekah> yes
2014 Jan 06 20:51 <trebla> neferty: you should copy it again (and check the paths)
2014 Jan 06 20:51 <soulseekah> I think we have like 200 cores now
2014 Jan 06 20:51 <cheetahburn> so trying out other ways like recreating key is still an option?
2014 Jan 06 20:51 <homevillageness> is it running now?
2014 Jan 06 20:51 <soulseekah> homevillageness: no but launch your lcients
2014 Jan 06 20:51 <soulseekah> and once we're off we'll get more people in
2014 Jan 06 20:51 <soulseekah> on it
2014 Jan 06 20:51 <soulseekah> from 2014
2014 Jan 06 20:51 <homevillageness> plus JustVisiting wants to lend cpu power, he is going to install ubuntu
2014 Jan 06 20:51 <VBFH> lol

2014 Jan 06 21:04 <brotherBox> Oh fuck it
2014 Jan 06 21:05 <MadPython> ERROR:root:Download failed, URL error: <urlopen error [Errno 110] Connection timed out>
2014 Jan 06 21:05 <MadPython> ERROR:root:Waiting 10.0 seconds before retrying
2014 Jan 06 21:05 <VBFH> lol
2014 Jan 06 21:05 <soulseekah> yes it's fine
2014 Jan 06 21:05 <soulseekah> MadPython: don't worry about it
2014 Jan 06 21:05 <soulseekah> we all are
2014 Jan 06 21:05 <soulseekah> the server is down
2014 Jan 06 21:05 <soulseekah> did you change to the new server?
2014 Jan 06 21:05 <soulseekah> keybreaker?
2014 Jan 06 21:05 <soulseekah> it's also down, but be patient
2014 Jan 06 21:05 <soulseekah> they're uploading the cicada bits
2014 Jan 06 21:05 <apx> soulseekah the log says no compiler is found
2014 Jan 06 21:06 <brotherBox> Install build-essential
2014 Jan 06 21:06 <soulseekah> apx: good catch
2014 Jan 06 21:06 <brotherBox> apt-get install build-essential gcc
2014 Jan 06 21:06 <iII> that's probably it
2014 Jan 06 21:06 <soulseekah> > no compiler found
2014 Jan 06 21:06 <soulseekah> no masterrace
2014 Jan 06 21:06 <brotherBox> By the way, how is there a linux without a compiler?
2014 Jan 06 21:06 <iII> mint should come with some of that stuff
2014 Jan 06 21:07 <iII> that's odd
2014 Jan 06 21:07 <brotherBox> Any *nix should come with that stuff
2014 Jan 06 21:07 <inabox> :S
2014 Jan 06 21:07 <PersonalKilljoy> mint should come with more stuff than ubuntu.......
2014 Jan 06 21:07 <soulseekah> > mint
2014 Jan 06 21:07 <soulseekah> neferty: update please :)
2014 Jan 06 21:07 <soulseekah> I think I know what happened
2014 Jan 06 21:07 <soulseekah> neferty: found that EC2 can factor on its own
2014 Jan 06 21:07 <PersonalKilljoy> lel
2014 Jan 06 21:07 <soulseekah> and is factoring alone right now
2014 Jan 06 21:08 <soulseekah> good guy neferty 
2014 Jan 06 21:08 <brotherBox> neferty pls
2014 Jan 06 21:08 <soulseekah> It's like we don't know what's going on
2014 Jan 06 21:08 <neferty> now mdzhb wants to put up a c90 test
2014 Jan 06 21:08 <neferty> just to make sure everything is 100% right
2014 Jan 06 21:08 <soulseekah> can we do
2014 Jan 06 21:08 <brotherBox> I did not engage in this form of elitism to be excluded frmo it
2014 Jan 06 21:08 <soulseekah> c50
2014 Jan 06 21:08 <soulseekah> not 90
2014 Jan 06 21:08 <soulseekah> c90 is gonna take half an hour
2014 Jan 06 21:08 <PersonalKilljoy> ce5 maybe?
2014 Jan 06 21:08 <neferty> i don't know how meaningful that is but idc
2014 Jan 06 21:08 <Ymgve> didn't I see something about cado not being designed for so low numbers?
2014 Jan 06 21:08 <neferty> also fighting amazon network rules
2014 Jan 06 21:09 <Ymgve> eh sure, do c90
2014 Jan 06 21:09 <Ymgve> then we can see how well the non-distributed parts are on your ec2 too
2014 Jan 06 21:09 <soulseekah> I'm all for c90
2014 Jan 06 21:09 <trebla> ok, this is going to need some cpu :)
2014 Jan 06 21:09 <trebla> if you want you can run som against oceania while waiting
2014 Jan 06 21:09 <inabox> zomg stuff is happening
2014 Jan 06 21:10 <trebla> i'm testing the 130 config on it right now
2014 Jan 06 21:10 <soulseekah> hold on
2014 Jan 06 21:10 <trebla> but it won't be able to do the matrix calculations
2014 Jan 06 21:10 <soulseekah> so are we doing c90?
2014 Jan 06 21:10 <soulseekah> on neferty ?
2014 Jan 06 21:10 <brotherBox> Firing on your command
2014 Jan 06 21:10 <PersonalKilljoy> are we doing neferty? O.o
2014 Jan 06 21:10 <soulseekah> You are supposed to already be fired
2014 Jan 06 21:10 <soulseekah> Everyone is supposed to be running
2014 Jan 06 21:10 <brotherBox> I actually am
2014 Jan 06 21:10 <soulseekah> and getting errors
2014 Jan 06 21:10 <soulseekah> with 10 second delays
2014 Jan 06 21:10 <soulseekah> if not - you're doing it wrong :D
2014 Jan 06 21:11 <soulseekah> server is: http://keybreaker.neferty.me:8001
2014 Jan 06 21:11 <brotherBox> I get timeouts
2014 Jan 06 21:11 <soulseekah> target is: c90
2014 Jan 06 21:11 <soulseekah> do we even have a good c90?
2014 Jan 06 21:11 <soulseekah> I only have a c100
2014 Jan 06 21:11 <soulseekah> and the numbers from here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_Factoring_Challenge are only c100+
2014 Jan 06 21:12 <eonn> lets just start the 130 
2014 Jan 06 21:12 <soulseekah> can someone multiply two 44-digit primes please?
2014 Jan 06 21:12 <soulseekah> eonn: we need a final test it seems
2014 Jan 06 21:13 <marcusw> still getting timeouts
2014 Jan 06 21:13 <soulseekah> marcusw: it's fine
2014 Jan 06 21:13 <soulseekah> everyone is
2014 Jan 06 21:13 <soulseekah> neferty: do we have a c90 in place?
2014 Jan 06 21:13 <soulseekah> what's taking so long?
2014 Jan 06 21:13 <Keeper> Nearly half an hour with timeouts and no updates
2014 Jan 06 21:13 <eonn> we are running out of time... we are trying to setup a working server for hours... and now there are enough fags here to start :) 
2014 Jan 06 21:13 <soulseekah> mdzhb: what's the holdup?
2014 Jan 06 21:13 <lvkm> 162816187601693953646480959369422342351453051124409814271066170853321675841485122128141
2014 Jan 06 21:13 <lvkm> 2 * 44 digit primes
2014 Jan 06 21:13 <soulseekah> lvkm: ^^ that's our c90
2014 Jan 06 21:13 <brotherBox> 1113171923169451643855885099404735289307103924845849320558226567408363311888172487210651L

2014 Jan 06 21:34 <homevillageness> got only 1
2014 Jan 06 21:34 <mdzhb> looks like broken clients have consumed the polys
2014 Jan 06 21:34 <mdzhb> :)
2014 Jan 06 21:34 <soulseekah> homevillageness: did you launch 4 clients?
2014 Jan 06 21:34 <soulseekah> mdzhb: or clients that didn't propery restart/abort
2014 Jan 06 21:34 <homevillageness> nope
2014 Jan 06 21:34 <neferty> i have 8 cores still working on their first poly
2014 Jan 06 21:35 <onimmino> I restarted my client. 404ing now.
2014 Jan 06 21:35 <iII> still working on first here too
2014 Jan 06 21:35 <Ymgve> or clients still on the old adress
2014 Jan 06 21:35 <PersonalKilljoy> 2 cores working on first, 2 idle
2014 Jan 06 21:35 <lvkm> 4 times on first
2014 Jan 06 21:35 <MadPython> i only use 25-30% of my cpu
2014 Jan 06 21:35 <brotherBox> Thats some pretty tough work
2014 Jan 06 21:35 <homevillageness> lets hope it doesnt wait till everyone is finished to give out new tasks
2014 Jan 06 21:35 <soulseekah> all cores loaded
2014 Jan 06 21:35 <MadPython> so 1 core maybe
2014 Jan 06 21:35 <mdzhb> homevillageness: it does.
2014 Jan 06 21:35 <soulseekah> I haven't submitted any one task atm
2014 Jan 06 21:35 <soulseekah> all still poly

2014 Jan 06 21:36 <cheetahburn> no work
2014 Jan 06 21:36 <trebla> no, the worst thing is if someone starts a task and disconnects, then that chunk will take one hour to timeout before it is handed out again
2014 Jan 06 21:36 <PersonalKilljoy> #alldone

2014 Jan 06 21:39 <brotherBox> Duly noted.
2014 Jan 06 21:39 <soulseekah> the chunks are too large
2014 Jan 06 21:39 <MadPython> Reticuli1: is gpu cracking possible with cado?
2014 Jan 06 21:40 <soulseekah> everyone finished before me
2014 Jan 06 21:40 <brotherBox> No.
2014 Jan 06 21:40 <Reticuli1> MadPython, not AFAIK

2014 Jan 06 21:44 <soulseekah> You have errors
2014 Jan 06 21:44 <doodleninja> I'm ubuntu i think
2014 Jan 06 21:44 <brotherBox> Apparently we have more cores than work to do
2014 Jan 06 21:44 <PersonalKilljoy> some people are afk but have their pcs mining
2014 Jan 06 21:44 <soulseekah> doodleninja: watch errors for output
2014 Jan 06 21:44 <soulseekah> brotherBox: yes
2014 Jan 06 21:44 <soulseekah> that's why I'm saying smaller chunks
2014 Jan 06 21:44 <PersonalKilljoy> smaller chunks maybe?
2014 Jan 06 21:44 <soulseekah> becuase many people are just waiting
2014 Jan 06 21:44 <shadowwalker> What happened?
2014 Jan 06 21:44 <soulseekah> for the slowheads like me
2014 Jan 06 21:44 <lvkm> yay one work finished

2014 Jan 06 21:45 <soulseekah> 4 and 8 cores
2014 Jan 06 21:45 <VBFH> ok we say x/y running, not x/y finished?
2014 Jan 06 21:45 <lvkm> sure?
2014 Jan 06 21:45 <homevillageness> soulseekah calls that a slowpoke

2014 Jan 06 21:47 <eonn> soulseekah
2014 Jan 06 21:47 <brotherBox> I don't give a shit at this ponit
2014 Jan 06 21:47 <soulseekah> eonn: what?
2014 Jan 06 21:47 <brotherBox> I've been working on this for 10 hours now
2014 Jan 06 21:47 <homevillageness> am 900k to 950k
2014 Jan 06 21:47 <soulseekah> you have larger ones
2014 Jan 06 21:47 <soulseekah> hmm

2014 Jan 06 21:47 <neferty> i cancelled all my WUs
2014 Jan 06 21:47 <lvkm> can you also lower the range?
2014 Jan 06 21:47 <soulseekah> 5/12 still running
2014 Jan 06 21:48 <soulseekah> smaller chunks
2014 Jan 06 21:48 <homevillageness> quite a lot lower chunks for my pc
2014 Jan 06 21:48 <eonn> yeah smaller chunks
2014 Jan 06 21:48 <homevillageness> xD
2014 Jan 06 21:48 <Reticuli1> Keep in mind everybody, you might be a 3301 this night 
2014 Jan 06 21:48 <trebla> then you have to restart everything
2014 Jan 06 21:48 <trebla> i say continue
2014 Jan 06 21:48 <mdzhb> no
2014 Jan 06 21:48 <neferty> no
2014 Jan 06 21:48 <mdzhb> i can set the WU timeout
2014 Jan 06 21:48 <PersonalKilljoy> i say restart
2014 Jan 06 21:48 <neferty> the server can continue
2014 Jan 06 21:48 <PersonalKilljoy> we will get faster
2014 Jan 06 21:48 <mdzhb> it should expire them
2014 Jan 06 21:48 <neferty> mdzhb: do it
2014 Jan 06 21:48 <trebla> mdzhb: on the fly?
2014 Jan 06 21:48 <HereticLocke> Back

2014 Jan 06 21:50 <soulseekah> oh man

2014 Jan 06 21:51 <lvkm> 1/4 for me too
2014 Jan 06 21:51 <neferty> soulseekah: after 10, but after restart it's gonna redistribute anyway

2014 Jan 06 21:51 <soulseekah> Server offline
2014 Jan 06 21:51 <homevillageness> should i kill or not?
2014 Jan 06 21:51 <neferty> mdzhb: did you fw them with iptables or?
2014 Jan 06 21:51 <mdzhb> yes
2014 Jan 06 21:51 <lvkm> no need to restart the client?
2014 Jan 06 21:51 <soulseekah> mdzhb: can you lower chunk sizes?
2014 Jan 06 21:51 <mdzhb> should be no need
2014 Jan 06 21:52 <soulseekah> but those who are still working stop
2014 Jan 06 21:52 <PersonalKilljoy> ^
2014 Jan 06 21:52 -soulseekah:#3301cado- If your client is still doing work and not erroring out - STOP
2014 Jan 06 21:52 <homevillageness> stopped
2014 Jan 06 21:52 <eonn> so we def. restart?
2014 Jan 06 21:52 <lvkm> well, it just finished
2014 Jan 06 21:52 <doodleninja> stopped
2014 Jan 06 21:52 <trebla> mdzhb: actually, if ppl don't finish their chunks in 10 minutes they will time out
2014 Jan 06 21:52 <neferty> mdzhb: fwiw i'm still getting no work available
2014 Jan 06 21:52 <eonn> stopped last chunk
2014 Jan 06 21:52 <soulseekah> lower chunks please
2014 Jan 06 21:53 <trebla> mdzhb: an the chunk will be handed out again
2014 Jan 06 21:53 <lvkm> that's why a smaller chunk size would be good
2014 Jan 06 21:53 <PersonalKilljoy> i agree with lower chunks
2014 Jan 06 21:53 <soulseekah> one that can be finshed in 2 minutes
2014 Jan 06 21:53 <homevillageness> it will take me more than 10 minutes to finish 10 chunk on this pc
2014 Jan 06 21:53 <trebla> yes, but the param file is complicated
2014 Jan 06 21:53 <PersonalKilljoy> else we will have exact same problem

2014 Jan 06 21:55 <soulseekah> got work!
2014 Jan 06 21:55 <Keeper> So all in all, I'm in with 4 clients resulting in a total of 6 cores
2014 Jan 06 21:55 <mdzhb> great
2014 Jan 06 21:55 -soulseekah:#3301cado- Start your clients and let them wait for work. We're running again!
2014 Jan 06 21:55 <mdzhb> then we're all out of work
2014 Jan 06 21:55 <brotherBox> Got work
2014 Jan 06 21:55 <mdzhb> for now
2014 Jan 06 21:55 <PersonalKilljoy> 404
2014 Jan 06 21:55 <iII> got work
2014 Jan 06 21:55 <homevillageness> got 404
2014 Jan 06 21:55 <eonn> Fans speeding up
2014 Jan 06 21:55 <iII> on only 1
2014 Jan 06 21:55 <cheetahburn> 404
2014 Jan 06 21:55 <eonn> how big is the chunk size mdzhb 
2014 Jan 06 21:55 <PersonalKilljoy> 404 on 4 cores
2014 Jan 06 21:56 <lvkm> 50k
2014 Jan 06 21:56 <soulseekah> yeh not all myt cores are loaded
2014 Jan 06 21:56 <mdzhb> i dont know what will happen if i change the chunksize now
2014 Jan 06 21:56 <eonn> i see
2014 Jan 06 21:56 <soulseekah> don't
2014 Jan 06 21:56 <eonn> DON'T
2014 Jan 06 21:56 <VBFH> 404 on all my 5
2014 Jan 06 21:56 <neferty> i only got one core working lol, but okay
2014 Jan 06 21:56 <eonn> i thought you've already done :S
2014 Jan 06 21:57 <mdzhb> going to see if i can tell which client is stuck
2014 Jan 06 21:57 <neferty> mdzhb: did you change wu timeout?
2014 Jan 06 21:57 <soulseekah> I'm still working

2014 Jan 06 21:58 <fl1pflop> yes me
2014 Jan 06 21:58 <soulseekah> okay

2014 Jan 06 21:58 <soulseekah> great
2014 Jan 06 21:58 <lvkm> my pc is happily idling
2014 Jan 06 21:58 <Ymgve> but only on one process
2014 Jan 06 21:58 <soulseekah> <3 you all guys
2014 Jan 06 21:58 <fl1pflop> mines'd one now
2014 Jan 06 21:58 <soulseekah> yes me too only 1 core
2014 Jan 06 21:58 <iII> I'm runnin one

2014 Jan 06 21:59 <JSG> 110 for me
2014 Jan 06 21:59 <soulseekah> mdzhb: is it difficult to lower chunks?
2014 Jan 06 21:59 <eonn> next time: chunk size=1k 
2014 Jan 06 21:59 <mdzhb> no
2014 Jan 06 21:59 <soulseekah> JSG: you must be one of the lucky broken clients
2014 Jan 06 21:59 <neferty> HereticLocke: that's good
2014 Jan 06 21:59 <HereticLocke> neferty: Okay
2014 Jan 06 21:59 <soulseekah> JSG: if you're not geting a connection on the server that is in the topic
2014 Jan 06 21:59 <soulseekah> chekc you command line and report back
2014 Jan 06 21:59 <neferty> okay i finished all tasks
2014 Jan 06 21:59 <soulseekah> for duty
2014 Jan 06 21:59 <lvkm> shouldn't it be a lil bit more?
2014 Jan 06 22:00 <soulseekah> still running...
2014 Jan 06 22:00 <lvkm> we just had chunk sizes of 50k?
2014 Jan 06 22:00 <soulseekah> 50k!?
2014 Jan 06 22:00 <soulseekah> that's too many numbers
2014 Jan 06 22:00 <soulseekah> and too little distribution it seems
2014 Jan 06 22:00 <soulseekah> I would go for 5k
2014 Jan 06 22:00 <soulseekah> since most cores here are idling
2014 Jan 06 22:00 <eonn> yeah. that's not efficient
2014 Jan 06 22:00 <lvkm> you 5k sounds better to me than 1k
2014 Jan 06 22:00 <lvkm> *yeah
2014 Jan 06 22:00 <soulseekah> out of 12 cores - 1 core is occupied here

2014 Jan 06 22:02 <soulseekah> 0/12
2014 Jan 06 22:02 <mdzhb> cause we were nearing the 10min limit
2014 Jan 06 22:02 <soulseekah> finished
2014 Jan 06 22:02 <homevillageness> Keeper i read that as 2 xD
2014 Jan 06 22:02 <eonn> results ?
2014 Jan 06 22:02 <mdzhb> im gonna to try to get a list of remaining WUs now
2014 Jan 06 22:02 <eonn> :X
2014 Jan 06 22:02 <Keeper> I'm running from rooted boxes as well lol
2014 Jan 06 22:02 <soulseekah> oh well
2014 Jan 06 22:02 <PersonalKilljoy> >safety
2014 Jan 06 22:02 <soulseekah> 0/12
2014 Jan 06 22:02 <soulseekah> Anyone else not finished?
2014 Jan 06 22:03 <Ymgve> me
2014 Jan 06 22:03 <soulseekah> k
2014 Jan 06 22:03 <Keeper> What are we doing now?
2014 Jan 06 22:03 <Ymgve> still the same one WU
2014 Jan 06 22:03 <soulseekah> Keeper: we be hacking
2014 Jan 06 22:03 <pierre`> Keeper: ahah
2014 Jan 06 22:03 <soulseekah> Ymgve: yeh they're huge
2014 Jan 06 22:03 <soulseekah> you're nearing the 10m limit it seems
2014 Jan 06 22:03 <Ymgve> well the first I got weren't huge
2014 Jan 06 22:03 <soulseekah> chunks are too large
2014 Jan 06 22:03 <Keeper> I'm getting 404 all day long
2014 Jan 06 22:03 <soulseekah> Keeper: that's fine
2014 Jan 06 22:03 <soulseekah> Patience is a virtue.
2014 Jan 06 22:03 <soulseekah> just keep those boxes running
2014 Jan 06 22:03 <MadPython> i think cado is bad programmed
2014 Jan 06 22:04 <Keeper> Approximately 6th time you mentioned this phrase
2014 Jan 06 22:04 <mdzhb> 3 WUs
2014 Jan 06 22:04 <MadPython> it would be much faster if nobody has to wait
2014 Jan 06 22:04 <mdzhb> still running
2014 Jan 06 22:04 <soulseekah> Keeper: ;)
2014 Jan 06 22:04 <soulseekah> MadPython: +1
2014 Jan 06 22:04 <soulseekah> chunk sizes will be decreased
2014 Jan 06 22:04 <neferty> guys we understand that you're all impatient to get cracking, but this is pretty difficult to orchestrate and we're doing our best with mdzhb to get it working
2014 Jan 06 22:04 <soulseekah> we don't want to waste the work
2014 Jan 06 22:04 <eonn> MadPython just a bad config, chunk size matters
2014 Jan 06 22:04 <VBFH> that's what she said
2014 Jan 06 22:04 <soulseekah> neferty, mdzhb I'd give you guys DOUBLE OP
2014 Jan 06 22:04 <soulseekah> much love
2014 Jan 06 22:04 <cheetahburn> dudes just leave them work, they're doing their best
2014 Jan 06 22:04 <soulseekah> :D
2014 Jan 06 22:05 <mdzhb> dont know what to do at this point, i cant easily release the WUs
2014 Jan 06 22:05 <lvkm> who is still working?
2014 Jan 06 22:05 <mdzhb> either we wait, or restart with a smaller chunksize
2014 Jan 06 22:05 <cheetahburn> provide coffee and sandwiches if you are impatient and wanna do something
2014 Jan 06 22:05 <JSG> still no connection (110) for me, got 404 15 min ago
2014 Jan 06 22:05 <Ymgve> I'm done
2014 Jan 06 22:05 <onimmino> One of mine is still working.
2014 Jan 06 22:05 <iII> my vote is smaller chunk size
2014 Jan 06 22:05 <homevillageness> still 404
2014 Jan 06 22:05 <MadPython> eonn: oh i understand but the waiting is basicly a bad idea in a pool cracking program
2014 Jan 06 22:05 <mdzhb> bard.86c458ce fd.67feeea3 ubuntu.9c2962d6L
2014 Jan 06 22:05 <mdzhb> those 3
2014 Jan 06 22:05 <onimmino> The last one is mine.
2014 Jan 06 22:06 <mdzhb> its still running?
2014 Jan 06 22:06 <soulseekah> still crunching?
2014 Jan 06 22:06 <onimmino> Yeah.
2014 Jan 06 22:06 <eonn> MadPython but you don't wait because cado is bad programmed
2014 Jan 06 22:06 <soulseekah> what's the log output
2014 Jan 06 22:06 <marcusw> I have one 404ing and one doing work
2014 Jan 06 22:06 <MadPython> eonn: so why i am waiting?
2014 Jan 06 22:06 <eonn> because there is no more work to do
2014 Jan 06 22:06 <soulseekah> AFter this guyse we'll go and program a decent cracker okay?
2014 Jan 06 22:06 <soulseekah> but for now this will ahve to do
2014 Jan 06 22:06 <eonn> because of huge chunks
2014 Jan 06 22:06 <iII> uh oh
2014 Jan 06 22:06 <lvkm> for next year?^^
2014 Jan 06 22:06 <iII> mdzhb: bard's me
2014 Jan 06 22:07 <iII> and I have no work listed
2014 Jan 06 22:07 <marcusw> pls to make chunks smaller?
2014 Jan 06 22:07 <MadPython> eonn: oh i understand.. we should reduce chunk size :P
2014 Jan 06 22:07 <soulseekah> yes
2014 Jan 06 22:07 <eonn> MadPython :P
2014 Jan 06 22:07 <soulseekah> but before that
2014 Jan 06 22:07 <soulseekah> we have to wait for all workers
2014 Jan 06 22:07 <soulseekah> so this work is not lost
2014 Jan 06 22:07 <soulseekah> and can be resumed
2014 Jan 06 22:07 <soulseekah> (hopefully)
2014 Jan 06 22:08 <iII> all my workers are sitting at waiting for work, but I'm listed above as the server waiting on me
2014 Jan 06 22:08 <mdzhb> Best polynomial previously found in /home/ubuntu/cicada_workdir/cicada.upload/cicada.polyselect.k9j50_.250000-300000 has Murphy_E = 6.51e-11
2014 Jan 06 22:08 <soulseekah> I hope that was mine
2014 Jan 06 22:08 <mdzhb> handing out some extra polys
2014 Jan 06 22:08 <mdzhb> and then ill just skip poly search
2014 Jan 06 22:08 <soulseekah> got 8 work
2014 Jan 06 22:08 <mdzhb> so crunch on ths
2014 Jan 06 22:08 <HereticLocke> It's working
2014 Jan 06 22:08 <soulseekah> Who hasn't got work?
2014 Jan 06 22:08 <PersonalKilljoy> 4/4
2014 Jan 06 22:08 <monkeybear> starting new chunk: 5950000-6000000
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <mdzhb> its an equal batch
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <homevillageness> i got work
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <homevillageness> 1/1
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <soulseekah> 8/8 for now
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <PersonalKilljoy> YEA
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <soulseekah> will wait so all get work
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <eonn> 4/4
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <soulseekah> then up to 12
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <cheetahburn> oh work
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <Keeper> Got work
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <VBFH> 5/5
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <Ymgve> I got 3/3
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <soulseekah> nice
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <HereticLocke> Stopped 
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <soulseekah> this is some sweet ass
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <trebla> wohoo, i got one
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <eonn> time to get some coffee... 10pm :P
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <brotherBox> 5900000-5950000
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <brotherBox> 7650000-7700000
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <fl1pflop> 1/4
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <mdzhb> pff, all out of work again
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <soulseekah> Anyone NOT GOT WORK?
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <exa> here.
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <Keeper> 6050000-6100000
2014 Jan 06 22:09 <neferty> i'm 4/6 right now
2014 Jan 06 22:10 <soulseekah> 8/8 still
2014 Jan 06 22:10 <lvkm> 4/4
2014 Jan 06 22:10 <PersonalKilljoy> 8750000-8800000
2014 Jan 06 22:10 <soulseekah> so we need smaller chunks next time
2014 Jan 06 22:10 <soulseekah> 1k even huh?
2014 Jan 06 22:10 <cheetahburn> uh that's some heavy working
2014 Jan 06 22:10 <soulseekah> since we have more cores
2014 Jan 06 22:10 <eonn> 4/4 .. 50k chunks..could take some time
2014 Jan 06 22:10 <mdzhb> ill just hand out more
2014 Jan 06 22:10 <soulseekah> but this round is much better
2014 Jan 06 22:10 <neferty> soulseekah: it's not as simple as "smaller chunks"
2014 Jan 06 22:10 <mdzhb> yeah
2014 Jan 06 22:10 <mdzhb> fuck
2014 Jan 06 22:10 <lvkm> isn't it still at 50k?
2014 Jan 06 22:10 <mdzhb> amjjawad.3b62c3fc
2014 Jan 06 22:10 <mdzhb> is broken
2014 Jan 06 22:10 <soulseekah> no it's 5k probably
2014 Jan 06 22:10 <soulseekah> amjjawad message me
2014 Jan 06 22:11 <eonn> who is amjjawad ??
2014 Jan 06 22:11 <lvkm> so the range diff is not the junk size?
2014 Jan 06 22:11 <Ymgve> what does a broken client do?
2014 Jan 06 22:11 <mdzhb> eat up all the WUs
2014 Jan 06 22:11 <Ymgve> how is that even possible
2014 Jan 06 22:11 <eonn> do we have to restart or will it be redistributed ?
2014 Jan 06 22:11 <JSG> I cant see why I get 110 since I got work 20 min ago 
2014 Jan 06 22:12 <Keeper> I'm 271c17f3, 82eda77 and f6c64c0d
2014 Jan 06 22:12 <mdzhb> they wont be redistributed due to the timeout, but i dont care
2014 Jan 06 22:12 <mdzhb> ill just make sure we'll have plenty
2014 Jan 06 22:12 <cheetahburn> still working
2014 Jan 06 22:12 <mdzhb> they idea, afaik, is to find a magic polynomial which is 'best'
2014 Jan 06 22:12 <mdzhb> so you just search for a specific time
2014 Jan 06 22:12 <Keeper> If only we had a guy inside the NSA..
2014 Jan 06 22:12 <mdzhb> then pick the best one you found
2014 Jan 06 22:13 <soulseekah> mdzhb: amjjawad.3b62c3fc working on it
2014 Jan 06 22:13 <soulseekah> looking though his logs
2014 Jan 06 22:13 <soulseekah> 8/8 working
2014 Jan 06 22:13 <soulseekah> If there's more work I can get 2 more pieces I guess
2014 Jan 06 22:13 <cheetahburn> still on polyselect
2014 Jan 06 22:14 <mdzhb> yeah, we're not gonna finish it
2014 Jan 06 22:14 <Keeper> 12650000-12700000
2014 Jan 06 22:14 <mdzhb> ill just let it run for a bit more
2014 Jan 06 22:14 <homevillageness> still on job 1
2014 Jan 06 22:14 <neferty> not gonna finish what?
2014 Jan 06 22:14 <soulseekah> majjaw is ERROR:root:Stderr: /bin/sh: 1: download//polyselect2l: not found
2014 Jan 06 22:14 <soulseekah> People look at your logs please
2014 Jan 06 22:14 <soulseekah> if you get ERROR
2014 Jan 06 22:14 <soulseekah> STOP
2014 Jan 06 22:14 <soulseekah> and message me
2014 Jan 06 22:14 <Ymgve> where do I find logs
2014 Jan 06 22:14 <PersonalKilljoy> 4 new chunks here
2014 Jan 06 22:14 <exa> 4/4
2014 Jan 06 22:15 <Ymgve> 3/3 new here
2014 Jan 06 22:15 <homevillageness> logs are in the terminal right?
2014 Jan 06 22:15 <soulseekah> yes
2014 Jan 06 22:15 <cheetahburn> Ymgve: it's the output
2014 Jan 06 22:15 <soulseekah> 8/8 here
2014 Jan 06 22:15 <soulseekah> should I launch more?
2014 Jan 06 22:15 <Ymgve> ok then, no errors there
2014 Jan 06 22:15 <lvkm> no
2014 Jan 06 22:15 <mdzhb> i don't know how the poly works, so cant tell if what we have is not going to be 'any' better
2014 Jan 06 22:15 <mdzhb> but we're still on the one we had
2014 Jan 06 22:15 <pierre`> [/win24
2014 Jan 06 22:17 <soulseekah> mdzhb: can I launch more clints?
2014 Jan 06 22:17 <Reticuli1> How is the C130 going?
2014 Jan 06 22:17 <Reticuli1> Just came back
2014 Jan 06 22:17 <PersonalKilljoy> guys
2014 Jan 06 22:17 <soulseekah> Reticuli1: fire up your client
2014 Jan 06 22:17 <neferty> soulseekah: don't oversaturate your own machine
2014 Jan 06 22:17 <lvkm> i think you shouldn't if you're full on 8
2014 Jan 06 22:17 <PersonalKilljoy> 400 people on #33012014
2014 Jan 06 22:17 <lvkm> because i'm pretty sure you got only 4 real cores and the other 4 are hyperthreading
2014 Jan 06 22:17 <neferty> i guess it's full reatrd mode
2014 Jan 06 22:18 <PersonalKilljoy> some newfags try to solve
2014 Jan 06 22:18 <homevillageness> you should join
2014 Jan 06 22:18 <PersonalKilljoy> but you know with that much spam....
2014 Jan 06 22:18 <homevillageness> its fun
2014 Jan 06 22:18 <homevillageness> to sometimes sad
2014 Jan 06 22:18 <VBFH> Eadwine: Yes! It's pointing on Mecca
2014 Jan 06 22:18 <Keeper> lel more work
2014 Jan 06 22:18 <mdzhb> 91 completed
2014 Jan 06 22:18 <soulseekah> neferty: okay
2014 Jan 06 22:18 <homevillageness> still doing first work
2014 Jan 06 22:18 <lvkm> 91 what?
2014 Jan 06 22:18 <Keeper> What digits are we doing btw?
2014 Jan 06 22:18 <lvkm> chunks?
2014 Jan 06 22:18 <cheetahburn> i got more work?
2014 Jan 06 22:19 <trebla> lvkm: yes, cache trashing basically ruins hyperthreading performance. Better to turn it off and only run 4 real cores.
2014 Jan 06 22:19 <mdzhb> yeah
2014 Jan 06 22:19 <mdzhb> ah
2014 Jan 06 22:19 <mdzhb> original admax was 5e6
2014 Jan 06 22:19 <Reticuli1> Errno 3310
2014 Jan 06 22:19 <mdzhb> chunksize is 5e4
2014 Jan 06 22:19 <Reticuli1> Errno 110
2014 Jan 06 22:19 <mdzhb> so we're supposed to reach 100
2014 Jan 06 22:20 <mdzhb> 108
2014 Jan 06 22:20 <brotherBox> Having good work
2014 Jan 06 22:20 <Keeper> Same
2014 Jan 06 22:20 <VBFH> same here
2014 Jan 06 22:20 <mdzhb> lets go till 130, because, y'know
2014 Jan 06 22:20 <mdzhb> ;)
2014 Jan 06 22:20 <Keeper> But I have to go off in a bit
2014 Jan 06 22:20 <brotherBox> This distributed stuff is awesome
2014 Jan 06 22:20 <mdzhb> is no better than current best with E=6.82e-11
2014 Jan 06 22:20 <lvkm> isn't hyperthreading supposed to reuse the cache? well, i only think starting too many clients will be a performance decrease
2014 Jan 06 22:20 <mdzhb> we found a new one btw
2014 Jan 06 22:20 <neferty> mdzhb: current crunching params look good
2014 Jan 06 22:21 <neferty> completed 6 or 7 WUs so far
2014 Jan 06 22:21 <homevillageness> 865k to 870k is still busy on my pc
2014 Jan 06 22:21 <trebla> what did you change?
2014 Jan 06 22:21 <soulseekah> having great work
2014 Jan 06 22:21 <PersonalKilljoy> i have 3 cores on chunk 3 and one on chunk 2

2014 Jan 06 22:21 <Keeper> Is it possible that we don't hit the primes lol?
2014 Jan 06 22:21 <eonn> one finished, got a new one
2014 Jan 06 22:21 <mdzhb> when we reach 130 ill end it, you can then kill your client and clear the workdir
2014 Jan 06 22:21 <eonn> 4/4
2014 Jan 06 22:21 <monkeybear> 14200000-14250000 and 15700000-15750000 
2014 Jan 06 22:22 <neferty> mdzhb: why?
2014 Jan 06 22:22 <soulseekah> becuase it's the end
2014 Jan 06 22:22 <mdzhb> because else it'll keep looking for a poly which we dont need anymore
2014 Jan 06 22:22 <soulseekah> we'd have the primes

2014 Jan 06 22:51 * Joins: malkuth (~bobrook@pool-96-231-164-204.washdc.fios.verizon.net)
2014 Jan 06 22:52 <gonflynn> It is not possible that n could be a product of two emirps. You can check that any emirps whose product ends in 6639 must have a product that starts with a 1, 5, 6 or 9, never a seven. This also rules out that n could be a product of two palindromic primes.
2014 Jan 06 22:52 <gonflynn> I have been running ECM factorisation and can so far confirm that any factors have at least 30 digits, but a distributed NFS approach will be needed to factor by brute force. I think this is what Cicada expects us to do.
2014 Jan 06 22:52 <soulseekah> me too
2014 Jan 06 22:52 <soulseekah> gonflynn: I'm gonna fuck you up
2014 Jan 06 22:52 * gonflynn was kicked by VBFH (gonflynn)
2014 Jan 06 22:52 <soulseekah> no offtopic please
2014 Jan 06 22:52 <soulseekah> sheesh
2014 Jan 06 22:52 <PersonalKilljoy> dat kick
2014 Jan 06 22:52 <VBFH> come on, first thing he says?
2014 Jan 06 22:52 * brotherBox changes topic to 'Use this instruction to set up your client: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=8vxVGVTW | server: http://54.201.197.81:8001 | PM @soulseekah for help | 404 error = no work. | Off-topic results in immediate kick'
2014 Jan 06 22:52 <PersonalKilljoy> vbfh you have best reflexes
2014 Jan 06 22:52 <soulseekah> yay
2014 Jan 06 22:52 <brotherBox> Its been that way ever since in here.
2014 Jan 06 22:53 <brotherBox> These are huge sets again
2014 Jan 06 22:53 <homevillageness> got the errors, it was a segmentation error
2014 Jan 06 22:53 <lvkm> i think they are smaller
2014 Jan 06 22:54 <lvkm> but the calculation gets more complex
2014 Jan 06 22:54 <marcusw> that was on-topic though...
2014 Jan 06 22:54 <soulseekah> marcusw: our topic is cado
2014 Jan 06 22:54 <soulseekah> homevillageness: hmmm, are you 32-bit?
2014 Jan 06 22:54 <homevillageness> yes
2014 Jan 06 22:56 <trebla> i'm still on the first set, if the sieving stage is going to take 10x more cpu work than the poly stage, then this will take time. I'll search for other computers to join in (my computers).
2014 Jan 06 22:56 <HereticLocke> soulseekah: Now running again
2014 Jan 06 22:56 <brotherBox> ^
2014 Jan 06 22:56 <soulseekah> HereticLocke: check for output
2014 Jan 06 22:56 <soulseekah> please
2014 Jan 06 22:56 <brotherBox> I will fucking stay up until this is done
2014 Jan 06 22:56 <soulseekah> brotherBox: seems like an overflow
2014 Jan 06 22:56 <lvkm> i'm also still at my first set :S
2014 Jan 06 22:56 <brotherBox> I don't care if its in an hour or 12 hours
2014 Jan 06 22:56 <soulseekah> it's 4AM here lol
2014 Jan 06 22:56 <soulseekah> won't quit
2014 Jan 06 22:56 <brotherBox> Thats the spirit!
2014 Jan 06 22:56 <soulseekah> wife is angry
2014 Jan 06 22:56 <mdzhb> we're at 0.2% percent for the first sieving stage
2014 Jan 06 22:56 <mdzhb> heh
2014 Jan 06 22:57 <soulseekah> oh shit
2014 Jan 06 22:57 <brotherBox> The fuck
2014 Jan 06 22:57 <cheetahburn> yeah i kinda don't wanna go to sleep either
2014 Jan 06 22:57 <PersonalKilljoy> wat
2014 Jan 06 22:57 <Surtri> ?
2014 Jan 06 22:57 <Surtri> wot
2014 Jan 06 22:57 <brotherBox> mdzhb pls
2014 Jan 06 22:57 <Surtri> Is samthing happening
2014 Jan 06 22:57 <soulseekah> and at this stage we can't get more people
2014 Jan 06 22:57 <trebla> yes, this stage is hughe compared to the previous
2014 Jan 06 22:57 <soulseekah> since they dont have the polys
2014 Jan 06 22:57 <brotherBox> mdzhb, where do you take this from?
2014 Jan 06 22:57 <Ymgve> in that pdf posted, what does (partially parallel) for linear algebra mean?
2014 Jan 06 22:57 <trebla> Ymgve: it is done on the server, not on the clients
2014 Jan 06 22:57 <brotherBox> Would more people help?
2014 Jan 06 22:57 <soulseekah> mdzhb: is the poly file the same for everyone?
2014 Jan 06 22:57 <lvkm> 26 hours
2014 Jan 06 22:58 <soulseekah> brotherBox: it would but I need to figure out how to get new clietns to join in
2014 Jan 06 22:58 <soulseekah> since they don't have the polys file
2014 Jan 06 22:58 <lvkm> 12-14 for sieving (parallel)
2014 Jan 06 22:58 <soulseekah> I can't get my server in
2014 Jan 06 22:58 <PersonalKilljoy> 425 users
2014 Jan 06 22:58 <soulseekah> without the polys file
2014 Jan 06 22:58 <mdzhb> soulseekah: yup
2014 Jan 06 22:58 <Ymgve> lvkm: note that that's a 155 digit number (I think)
2014 Jan 06 22:58 <soulseekah> mdzhb: can you publish it
2014 Jan 06 22:58 <trebla> but we have less bits in our number
2014 Jan 06 22:58 <soulseekah> so new clients can join
2014 Jan 06 22:58 <soulseekah> also has anyone hit the timout?
2014 Jan 06 22:58 <trebla> and still the same server capacity or more
2014 Jan 06 22:58 <lvkm> well on 8x large memory optimized clusters
2014 Jan 06 22:58 <PersonalKilljoy> im still sieving
2014 Jan 06 22:58 <trebla> so that stage will probably go faster than 26 hours
2014 Jan 06 22:58 <PersonalKilljoy> so not sure
2014 Jan 06 22:59 <mdzhb> dont make estimates yet
2014 Jan 06 22:59 <trebla> just guesses :)
2014 Jan 06 22:59 <mdzhb> I had to mark some expired WUs as assigned, as to not to lose them
2014 Jan 06 22:59 * Joins: gonflynn (~gonflynn@80.30.48.152)
2014 Jan 06 22:59 <mdzhb> seems it's going up steadily now
2014 Jan 06 22:59 <lvkm> my guess is linear algebra will be about twice the time than sieving
2014 Jan 06 22:59 <monkeybear> finally finished one of the first ones
2014 Jan 06 22:59 <mdzhb> as in, 1%
2014 Jan 06 22:59 <homevillageness> should i rejoin?
2014 Jan 06 22:59 <soulseekah> 4/4 none finished yet
2014 Jan 06 23:00 <mdzhb> I have no idea how many sieving stages we need
2014 Jan 06 23:00 <mdzhb> probably plenty
2014 Jan 06 23:00 <mdzhb> o client ubuntu.e4e556fcL
2014 Jan 06 23:00 <brotherBox> I think in this case...staying up is not really possible
2014 Jan 06 23:00 <mdzhb> die in a fire
2014 Jan 06 23:00 <soulseekah> homevillageness: I don't know mdzhb should segfault rejoin?
2014 Jan 06 23:00 <eonn> 4/4 non finished
2014 Jan 06 23:00 <brotherBox> mdzhb, what does he do?
2014 Jan 06 23:00 <soulseekah> ubuntu is Keeper 
2014 Jan 06 23:00 <mdzhb> its broken
2014 Jan 06 23:00 <Keeper> Keeper is going to sleep
2014 Jan 06 23:00 <Keeper> Finishing this job and powering off
2014 Jan 06 23:00 <soulseekah> Keeper: check for erros
2014 Jan 06 23:00 <soulseekah> or power off
2014 Jan 06 23:00 <soulseekah> is your hostname ubuntu?
2014 Jan 06 23:00 <mdzhb> soulseekah: there are probably more ubuntus
2014 Jan 06 23:00 <Keeper> yes
2014 Jan 06 23:01 <soulseekah> who is ubuntu hostname as well?
2014 Jan 06 23:01 * brotherBox isn't
2014 Jan 06 23:01 <mdzhb> 109.199.x.x - but seems to have stopped now
2014 Jan 06 23:01 <soulseekah> mdzhb: should I try uploading the polys from my desktop to my server?
2014 Jan 06 23:01 <brotherBox> Do the polys change over time?
2014 Jan 06 23:01 <mdzhb> soulseekah: lets see, sec
2014 Jan 06 23:01 <soulseekah> if they're the same it should work fine right?
2014 Jan 06 23:01 <mdzhb> no
2014 Jan 06 23:01 <mdzhb> i think its 'the' poly
2014 Jan 06 23:01 <Keeper> Anyway, I'm off. Hope I've been of some assistance.
2014 Jan 06 23:01 <soulseekah> right
2014 Jan 06 23:01 <brotherBox> Good night Keeper
2014 Jan 06 23:01 <brotherBox> Thanks for your efforts!
2014 Jan 06 23:01 <eonn> gn8! thanks
2014 Jan 06 23:02 <mdzhb> yeah
2014 Jan 06 23:02 <brotherBox> I have an idea
2014 Jan 06 23:02 <mdzhb> you can copy it

2014 Jan 06 23:02 <soulseekah> okay
2014 Jan 06 23:02 <soulseekah> great
2014 Jan 06 23:02 <mdzhb> its correct
2014 Jan 06 23:03 <brotherBox> Oh fuck
2014 Jan 06 23:03 <mdzhb> that was its md5 and sha1
2014 Jan 06 23:03 <soulseekah> so I will provide more instructions 
2014 Jan 06 23:03 <soulseekah> for those who missed the poly stage
2014 Jan 06 23:03 <brotherBox> I switched them up
2014 Jan 06 23:03 <soulseekah> ne0_ and gonflynn get your clients ready
2014 Jan 06 23:03 <gonflynn> getting there

2014 Jan 06 23:03 <ne0_> give me a second...
2014 Jan 06 23:03 <apx> I have quite some processes running tho...
2014 Jan 06 23:03 <pierre`> soulseekah: will run 24/24 til the number is factorized
2014 Jan 06 23:04 <mdzhb> 6%
2014 Jan 06 23:04 <soulseekah> that's fast
2014 Jan 06 23:04 <soulseekah> poly is at
2014 Jan 06 23:04 <iII> just got back, where are we?
2014 Jan 06 23:04 <soulseekah> http://codeseekah.com/cicada/cicada.polyselect.poly
2014 Jan 06 23:04 <eonn> 6%? great!
2014 Jan 06 23:04 <mdzhb> now someone figure out if there's any reason to num_of_relations && chance those are enough
2014 Jan 06 23:05 <mdzhb> because for the other attempts it took some additional relations
2014 Jan 06 23:05 <mdzhb> but not twice as many
2014 Jan 06 23:05 <apx> soulseekah 403
2014 Jan 06 23:05 <neferty> mdzhb: on my first c100 try it was about ~150%
2014 Jan 06 23:06 <soulseekah> apx: will fix sorry
2014 Jan 06 23:06 <mdzhb> yeah
2014 Jan 06 23:06 <mdzhb> i dont dare to suggest its THAT easy
2014 Jan 06 23:06 <mdzhb> :x
2014 Jan 06 23:06 <mdzhb> on the other hand, i dont know how many cores we have
2014 Jan 06 23:06 <mdzhb> effectively
2014 Jan 06 23:07 <cheetahburn> so still no estimates how long this will take?
2014 Jan 06 23:07 <lvkm> how many clients?
2014 Jan 06 23:07 <cheetahburn> i got a job to attend to tomorrow
2014 Jan 06 23:07 <mdzhb> cheetahburn: well, 1.5x the initial num of relations was okay for the prev. runs
2014 Jan 06 23:07 <mdzhb> seems optimistic though
2014 Jan 06 23:07 <mdzhb> (and then it needs to do preprocessing, singlecore)
2014 Jan 06 23:07 <soulseekah> http://codeseekah.com/cicada/cicada.polyselect.poly
2014 Jan 06 23:07 <soulseekah> is up
2014 Jan 06 23:08 <neferty> i'd say 2 days
2014 Jan 06 23:08 <apx> thx soulseekah 
2014 Jan 06 23:08 <mdzhb> probably will take some overnight
2014 Jan 06 23:08 <soulseekah> for the ones who missed the poly stage
2014 Jan 06 23:08 <soulseekah> will try starting it again
2014 Jan 06 23:08 <neferty> soulseekah: wasn't your poly a different md5 though?
2014 Jan 06 23:08 <pierre`> cheetahburn: i'm a doctor in my country, can write a letter for you :D
2014 Jan 06 23:08 <soulseekah> neferty: mine is sha1
2014 Jan 06 23:08 <soulseekah> not md5
2014 Jan 06 23:08 <cheetahburn> pierre`: lol
2014 Jan 06 23:08 <soulseekah> it matched
2014 Jan 06 23:08 <neferty> soulseekah: oh, right, okay lol
2014 Jan 06 23:08 <VBFH> btw: if the primes don't decode the message, I would suggest to turn 'n' around and test that. because all the paintings in the image are flipped somehow and the name is 1033.jpg
2014 Jan 06 23:08 <neferty> soulseekah: what was your sha?
2014 Jan 06 23:08 <cheetahburn> mdzhb: is neferty right with his 2 days estimate?
2014 Jan 06 23:09 <soulseekah> VBFH: that would be a nightmare
2014 Jan 06 23:09 <cheetahburn> i just need a roundabout... 2 hours or 2 days or 2 weeks
2014 Jan 06 23:09 <soulseekah> 2 hours
2014 Jan 06 23:09 <soulseekah> I say
2014 Jan 06 23:09 <soulseekah> if 'ts alread y6%
2014 Jan 06 23:09 <trebla> VBFH: it's easy to verify, just multiply them together and see if you get N
2014 Jan 06 23:09 <soulseekah> more cores will join
2014 Jan 06 23:09 <neferty> cheetahburn: it's a very rought estimate, but i'd say given previous tests, it's not too far off
2014 Jan 06 23:09 <neferty> soulseekah: linalg phase will take WAY longer
2014 Jan 06 23:09 <PersonalKilljoy> im uploading 4 chunks atm
2014 Jan 06 23:09 <neferty> and that's serverside only
2014 Jan 06 23:09 <soulseekah> neferty: hmm probably
2014 Jan 06 23:09 <soulseekah> okay
2014 Jan 06 23:09 <soulseekah> but still
2014 Jan 06 23:09 <soulseekah> let's sieve
2014 Jan 06 23:09 <VBFH> trebla, yeah, but maybe the 'n' is turned around in the first place
2014 Jan 06 23:09 <soulseekah> on
2014 Jan 06 23:09 <soulseekah> I'd hate that
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <cheetahburn> so i can go to sleep and just leave the server running?
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <soulseekah> why isn't the e turned around then?
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <mdzhb> who's 'elementary'? :)
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <soulseekah> he'd turn it around
2014 Jan 06 23:10 * soulseekah is not
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <trebla> VBFH: ah, that would be really strange. but who knows.
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <mdzhb> he's finished 3
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <cheetahburn> well not yet but soon
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <mdzhb> rest hasnt
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <mdzhb> :)
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <soulseekah> I finished 4 no?
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <PersonalKilljoy> i have finished 4
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <soulseekah> wth
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <VBFH> just saying that this would be a possible next step if this one fails
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <soulseekah> are we timing out?
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <mdzhb> oh soulseekah did too
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <soulseekah> I did 4 at least
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <PersonalKilljoy> and me?
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <trebla> mdzhb: should we kill clients that are sieving?
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <soulseekah> PersonalKilljoy: what's you id?
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <mdzhb> i need to do some sqlite query crafting for this
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <PersonalKilljoy> Killjoy
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <soulseekah> trebla: noooo
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <mdzhb> trebla: no
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <soulseekah> sieving is the current task
2014 Jan 06 23:10 <soulseekah> las
2014 Jan 06 23:11 <trebla> ok, I was away
2014 Jan 06 23:11 <soulseekah> anyone who is still poly step should stop
2014 Jan 06 23:11 <soulseekah> and download http://codeseekah.com/cicada/cicada.polyselect.poly
2014 Jan 06 23:11 <soulseekah> into download
2014 Jan 06 23:11 <soulseekah> is there anyone who is not sieving yet?

2014 Jan 06 23:13 <soulseekah> I need download//cicada.factorbase.roots.gz:
2014 Jan 06 23:13 <mdzhb> linode seems to be acting up
2014 Jan 06 23:13 <mdzhb> yeah
2014 Jan 06 23:13 <lvkm> i just mean it checks if it exists (and if it doesn't it SHOULD download it)

2014 Jan 06 23:13 <mdzhb> soulseekah: is your client wrongly patched perhaps?
2014 Jan 06 23:13 <soulseekah> mdzhb: no no
2014 Jan 06 23:13 <soulseekah> it's the missign files
2014 Jan 06 23:13 <HereticLocke> Does anyone know how to set this up on CentOS?
2014 Jan 06 23:13 <brotherBox> soulseekah, can you make a tar.gz of the needed files?
2014 Jan 06 23:13 <soulseekah> from the prev. step
2014 Jan 06 23:13 <cheetahburn> my server will run into eternity, so it's fine
2014 Jan 06 23:13 <MadPython> my rpi can crack in the meanwhile ;)
2014 Jan 06 23:13 <mdzhb> so, anyone have a Xeon Phi? ;)
2014 Jan 06 23:14 <PersonalKilljoy> guys do we let more people in?
2014 Jan 06 23:14 <brotherBox> PersonalKilljoy, I have made a channel #3301linux in which I'm going to teach people how to cado

2014 Jan 06 23:15 <inabox> What's poly step?
2014 Jan 06 23:15 <brotherBox> soulseekah, is that the files we need?
2014 Jan 06 23:15 <exa> soulseekah: sha1 is correct

2014 Jan 06 23:16 <soulseekah> if you are NOT WORKING RIGHT NOW
2014 Jan 06 23:16 <soulseekah> then you missed poly step
2014 Jan 06 23:16 <trebla> I just sneaked into my sons room and turned on his computer, he is sleeping :)
2014 Jan 06 23:16 <soulseekah> so please
2014 Jan 06 23:16 <soulseekah> wget http://codeseekah.com/cicada/cicada.factorbase.roots.gz -O download/cicada.factorbase.roots.gz
2014 Jan 06 23:16 <soulseekah> from the cado root
2014 Jan 06 23:16 <MadPython> trebla: :D
2014 Jan 06 23:16 <brotherBox> soulseekah, will that be enough?
2014 Jan 06 23:16 <MadPython> i will turn on my two old pcs tommorow
2014 Jan 06 23:16 <mdzhb> more. cores.
2014 Jan 06 23:16 <mdzhb> 10%
2014 Jan 06 23:17 <trebla> already??
2014 Jan 06 23:17 <PersonalKilljoy> hey guise
2014 Jan 06 23:17 <PersonalKilljoy> there are like 400 people
2014 Jan 06 23:17 <eonn> great progress
2014 Jan 06 23:17 <PersonalKilljoy> doing nothing in the main chan
2014 Jan 06 23:17 <soulseekah> and http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=gpRREVYd
2014 Jan 06 23:17 <soulseekah> brotherBox: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=gpRREVYd
2014 Jan 06 23:17 <lvkm> my lazy pc didn't solv any sieve yet :(
2014 Jan 06 23:17 <soulseekah> please
2014 Jan 06 23:17 <soulseekah> wget http://codeseekah.com/cicada/cicada.polyselect.poly -O download/cicada.polyselect.poly
2014 Jan 06 23:17 <lvkm> but how many of them are running linux?
2014 Jan 06 23:17 <soulseekah> wget http://codeseekah.com/cicada/cicada.factorbase.roots.gz -O download/cicada.factorbase.roots.gz
2014 Jan 06 23:17 <fl1pflop> they could install vm
2014 Jan 06 23:17 <MadPython> lvkm: it also works on a live cd or usb stick
2014 Jan 06 23:17 <soulseekah> PersonalKilljoy: let me first see if starting a new client with poly and root helps
2014 Jan 06 23:17 <soulseekah> if it doesn't there's no way for them to goin right now
2014 Jan 06 23:18 <PersonalKilljoy> oki
2014 Jan 06 23:18 <soulseekah> hold on ples
2014 Jan 06 23:18 <soulseekah> wget http://codeseekah.com/cicada/cicada.polyselect.poly -O download/cicada.polyselect.poly
2014 Jan 06 23:18 <eonn> soulseekah, just update your instructions (add wget *) and lets invite some other linux users
2014 Jan 06 23:18 <soulseekah> wget http://codeseekah.com/cicada/cicada.factorbase.roots.gz -O download/cicada.factorbase.roots.gz
2014 Jan 06 23:18 <soulseekah> for the new onews
2014 Jan 06 23:18 <PersonalKilljoy> brother read that too
2014 Jan 06 23:18 <soulseekah> eonn: I haven't tested yet
2014 Jan 06 23:18 <lvkm> well, and how many people can that set up?
2014 Jan 06 23:18 <soulseekah> brotherBox: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=gpRREVYd
2014 Jan 06 23:18 <soulseekah> please
2014 Jan 06 23:18 <trebla> fl1pflop: good idea, if somebody makes a vm they can just start that get going
2014 Jan 06 23:18 <soulseekah> in topic
2014 Jan 06 23:18 * brotherBox changes topic to 'Use this instruction to set up your client: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=gpRREVYd | server: http://54.201.197.81:8001 | PM @soulseekah for help | 404 error = no work. | Off-topic results in immediate kick'
2014 Jan 06 23:18 <mdzhb> not sure what the vm overhead is?
2014 Jan 06 23:18 <lvkm> in theory it's pretty easy, but there are people who fail at turning their monitor on…
2014 Jan 06 23:18 <soulseekah> mdzhb: watch out for bad linode shit
2014 Jan 06 23:18 <brotherBox> soulseekah, have that in #3301linux as well
2014 Jan 06 23:18 <mdzhb> soulseekah: on it
2014 Jan 06 23:18 <fl1pflop> mdzhb, I don't think much
2014 Jan 06 23:19 <fl1pflop> also it's better to have more
2014 Jan 06 23:19 <soulseekah> yay it worked!!!!!
2014 Jan 06 23:19 <mdzhb> sure?
2014 Jan 06 23:19 <mdzhb> seems bad
2014 Jan 06 23:19 <soulseekah> hmm
2014 Jan 06 23:19 <mdzhb> yeah
2014 Jan 06 23:19 <soulseekah> ERROR:root:Command exited with exit code -11
2014 Jan 06 23:19 <soulseekah> fuck
2014 Jan 06 23:19 <soulseekah> I wonder why that
2014 Jan 06 23:20 <lvkm> same linux distribution?
2014 Jan 06 23:20 <lvkm> same package versions?

2014 Jan 06 23:20 <soulseekah> I'm moving
2014 Jan 06 23:20 <soulseekah> :D
2014 Jan 06 23:20 <soulseekah> what use are your 8 cores if you can't do shit
2014 Jan 06 23:21 <soulseekah> so but yes
2014 Jan 06 23:21 <soulseekah> new clients can hop on
2014 Jan 06 23:21 <mdzhb> did you compile the binaries on that box?
2014 Jan 06 23:21 <soulseekah> mdzhb: sure
2014 Jan 06 23:21 <soulseekah> it's same arch linux box
2014 Jan 06 23:21 <soulseekah> poly step was fine
2014 Jan 06 23:21 <soulseekah> I participated in that
2014 Jan 06 23:21 <soulseekah> but then las broke
2014 Jan 06 23:21 <soulseekah> it starts and runs for a sec or two
2014 Jan 06 23:21 <soulseekah> then segfaults
2014 Jan 06 23:21 <soulseekah> no idea why
2014 Jan 06 23:21 * MadPython is now known as MadPython_AFK
2014 Jan 06 23:21 <iII> mine was doing that
2014 Jan 06 23:21 <soulseekah> is anyone running las on a virtualbox?
2014 Jan 06 23:22 <soulseekah> iII: how did you fix?
2014 Jan 06 23:22 <MadPython_AFK> soulseekah: no but on a live usb stick
2014 Jan 06 23:22 <iII> haven't yet
2014 Jan 06 23:22 <iII> but that was on a vm
2014 Jan 06 23:22 <soulseekah> Anyone without work right now?
2014 Jan 06 23:22 <PersonalKilljoy> me
2014 Jan 06 23:22 <soulseekah> Ymgve: you're on a vm right?
2014 Jan 06 23:22 <PersonalKilljoy> but my pc is lagging
2014 Jan 06 23:22 <Ymgve> yeah
2014 Jan 06 23:22 <iII> my actual machine is still going fine
2014 Jan 06 23:22 <soulseekah> no segrauls?

2014 Jan 06 23:24 <PersonalKilljoy> L0j1k, Tech1, counterhash
2014 Jan 06 23:24 <PersonalKilljoy> i suppose
2014 Jan 06 23:24 <PersonalKilljoy> but they are not here
2014 Jan 06 23:24 <Surtri> soulseekah: 
2014 Jan 06 23:24 <Surtri> shecalledmepaul has nvidia gpu
2014 Jan 06 23:24 <Surtri> is that still going on? I was afk
2014 Jan 06 23:24 <cheetahburn> mine is working a long time for one package still

2014 Jan 06 23:24 <Surtri> Ok
2014 Jan 06 23:24 <Surtri> I'll see if he has linux
2014 Jan 06 23:24 <soulseekah> but if he has CPU and linux
2014 Jan 06 23:24 <soulseekah> come in
2014 Jan 06 23:24 <lvkm> i still haven't finish my first set :S
2014 Jan 06 23:24 <soulseekah> CPU and linux welcome at this point
2014 Jan 06 23:25 <JustVisiting> Taiiwo?
2014 Jan 06 23:25 <soulseekah> Should we have a round of spam?
2014 Jan 06 23:25 <Surtri> windows
2014 Jan 06 23:25 <eonn> 4/4 running.
2014 Jan 06 23:25 <PersonalKilljoy> soul: did you manage to bring people in?
2014 Jan 06 23:25 <soulseekah> no windoews sorry
2014 Jan 06 23:25 <Surtri> I told him
2014 Jan 06 23:25 <neferty> lvkm: i just began my second not so long ago, so don't worry
2014 Jan 06 23:25 <soulseekah> Yes, atm we are able to have clients do the sieve part
2014 Jan 06 23:25 <JustVisiting> So it's OK to invite people that run Linux?
2014 Jan 06 23:25 <soulseekah> People
2014 Jan 06 23:25 <neferty> it took me half an hour
2014 Jan 06 23:25 <soulseekah> Are we unanimous on bringing more poeple in?
2014 Jan 06 23:25 <JustVisiting> Aye
2014 Jan 06 23:25 <shadowwalker> Yes.
2014 Jan 06 23:25 <soulseekah> by spamming 2014?
2014 Jan 06 23:25 <PersonalKilljoy> but
2014 Jan 06 23:25 <soulseekah> brotherBox: ?
2014 Jan 06 23:25 <PersonalKilljoy> can we join them?
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <PersonalKilljoy> i mean
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <soulseekah> mdzhb: ?
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <soulseekah> More people?
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <JustVisiting> Let's not spam, but ask directly instead?
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <soulseekah> with linux?
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <gonflynn> soulseekah: I'm almost done but having a stupid problem with the install, no such file or directory when cp -rv build/....
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <iII> sure, why not
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <brotherBox> #3301linux
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <PersonalKilljoy> can they join us after poly part?
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <soulseekah> gonflynn: wrong directory?
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <gonflynn> yeah, don't know why?
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <soulseekah> PersonalKilljoy: yes they can
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <soulseekah> brotherBox: okay
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <JustVisiting> gonflynn, make sure it's 2L not 21. That was my problem.
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <PersonalKilljoy> so souldi spam 2014?
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <soulseekah> pelase iwth linux
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <JustVisiting> gonflynn, I typed instead of copy/paste
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <soulseekah> have them here
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <soulseekah> spam
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <soulseekah> but only with Linux boxes
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <soulseekah> no VMS
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <gonflynn> ok, will try that
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <mdzhb> good news
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <soulseekah> VMs are segfaulting it seems
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <mdzhb> i found 16 cores
2014 Jan 06 23:26 <soulseekah> (not all)
2014 Jan 06 23:27 <soulseekah> mdzhb: nice!
2014 Jan 06 23:27 <JustVisiting> Whoa!
2014 Jan 06 23:27 <soulseekah> sweet
2014 Jan 06 23:27 <fl1pflop> my vm is not segfaulting
2014 Jan 06 23:27 <lvkm> maybe it depends on the kind of vm?
2014 Jan 06 23:27 <lvkm> what's your hypervisor?
2014 Jan 06 23:27 <iII> I'm about 20 mins away from finding out if I can get us 250+ cores
2014 Jan 06 23:28 <iII> depens what that cluster is doing today etc
2014 Jan 06 23:28 <fl1pflop> lvkm, vmware
2014 Jan 06 23:28 <soulseekah> iII: it need network
2014 Jan 06 23:28 <soulseekah> iII: and possibly root
2014 Jan 06 23:28 <soulseekah> fl1pflop: good to know
2014 Jan 06 23:28 <soulseekah> but some VMs are segfaulting
2014 Jan 06 23:28 <onimmino> My VM started segfaulting on sieving, so I've stopped it for now. I'm on VMware as well.
2014 Jan 06 23:28 <soulseekah> my arch xen on linode is segging
2014 Jan 06 23:29 <iII> it'd definately have netwrok
2014 Jan 06 23:29 <soulseekah> so some things are segfaulting
2014 Jan 06 23:29 <lvkm> seems to be pretty random
2014 Jan 06 23:29 <soulseekah> okay
2014 Jan 06 23:29 <soulseekah> new poeple please
2014 Jan 06 23:29 <soulseekah> with linux
2014 Jan 06 23:29 <Surtri> soulseekah: I'll try to find people with linux
2014 Jan 06 23:29 <soulseekah> Surtri: thanks
2014 Jan 06 23:29 <Surtri> np
2014 Jan 06 23:29 * soulseekah sets mode: +o Surtri
2014 Jan 06 23:29 <soulseekah> you can invite
2014 Jan 06 23:29 <JustVisiting> Ok, SheCalledMePaul will have Linux in a bit. 
2014 Jan 06 23:30 * soulseekah sets mode: +v JustVisiting
2014 Jan 06 23:30 <trebla> soulseekah: maybe create a new tgz first, with the python file pre-patched, and the Makefile patched to copy the necessary files into downloads/
2014 Jan 06 23:30 <soulseekah> ehm
2014 Jan 06 23:30 <trebla> when running make
2014 Jan 06 23:30 <JustVisiting> TY for voice. Are we gonna be moderated soon? :) 
2014 Jan 06 23:30 <soulseekah> trebla: okay
2014 Jan 06 23:30 <soulseekah> I guess I could try that
2014 Jan 06 23:30 <gonflynn> is it polyselect2l.c?
2014 Jan 06 23:30 <Lurker69> thy cant all be planted by illuminati <-----al tinofil heads MUST WATCH
2014 Jan 06 23:30 <Lurker69> ups
2014 Jan 06 23:31 <Surtri> soulseekah: 
2014 Jan 06 23:31 <soulseekah> gonflynn: wat?
2014 Jan 06 23:31 <soulseekah> Surtri: what?
2014 Jan 06 23:31 <Surtri> I think shecalledmepaul is going to install ubuntu
2014 Jan 06 23:31 <soulseekah> okay
2014 Jan 06 23:31 <Surtri> ok
2014 Jan 06 23:31 <soulseekah> fine
2014 Jan 06 23:31 <Surtri> I found someone with linux
2014 Jan 06 23:31 <gonflynn> I still can't find polyselect2L its not in polyselect folder
2014 Jan 06 23:31 <Surtri> where do they join, here?
2014 Jan 06 23:31 <Surtri> Or 3301linux
2014 Jan 06 23:31 <soulseekah> gonflynn: did you make fine?
2014 Jan 06 23:31 <soulseekah> Surtri: doesn't matter
2014 Jan 06 23:31 <Surtri> I'll invite here
2014 Jan 06 23:31 <soulseekah> I don't care
2014 Jan 06 23:31 <PersonalKilljoy> #3301linux
2014 Jan 06 23:31 <Surtri> ok
2014 Jan 06 23:31 <Surtri> I'll tell him to go there
2014 Jan 06 23:31 <soulseekah> just get cores please
2014 Jan 06 23:31 <gonflynn> Im gonna make again
2014 Jan 06 23:31 <soulseekah> so we can finish and go to bed
2014 Jan 06 23:31 <gonflynn> Oh and a
2014 Jan 06 23:32 <gonflynn> im linux mint
2014 Jan 06 23:32 <soulseekah> good
2014 Jan 06 23:32 <soulseekah> I will do new tar.gz
2014 Jan 06 23:32 <soulseekah> with the poly files built in
2014 Jan 06 23:32 <soulseekah> and the download folder ready
2014 Jan 06 23:33 <Ymgve> neferty: what is the server running on
2014 Jan 06 23:33 <PersonalKilljoy> yay second chunks finished
2014 Jan 06 23:34 <neferty> Ymgve: c3.xlarge ec2 instance, ubuntu image
2014 Jan 06 23:34 * Quits: shadowwalker (~shadowwal@unaffiliated/shadowwalker1337) (Remote host closed the connection)
2014 Jan 06 23:34 <Ymgve> why not 8xlarge
2014 Jan 06 23:34 <JustVisiting> Chunk 3 for me, times 4.
2014 Jan 06 23:34 <Ymgve> or doesn't it help for the linear algebra step
2014 Jan 06 23:34 <neferty> because i'm not THAT rich :p, plus because there's not much point, shitty perl script won't run any faster anyway
2014 Jan 06 23:35 <neferty> for the most part it's idling anyway
2014 Jan 06 23:35 <Ymgve> what's taking so much time then
2014 Jan 06 23:35 <cheetahburn> neferty: what're you paying for it?
2014 Jan 06 23:35 <neferty> http://i.imgur.com/UCxsQwB.png
2014 Jan 06 23:35 <neferty> Ymgve: clients working
2014 Jan 06 23:35 <neferty> cheetahburn: depends on how long it takes
2014 Jan 06 23:35 <Ymgve> neferty: I mean the linear algebra step
2014 Jan 06 23:35 <neferty> it's something like $0.66 hourly i think
2014 Jan 06 23:35 <gonflynn> seems I'm missing pthread, trying to install it
2014 Jan 06 23:35 <Ymgve> which is not distributed
2014 Jan 06 23:36 <neferty> Ymgve: well yeah, that's the difficult part, but it's not paralellized well either
2014 Jan 06 23:36 <cheetahburn> neferty: if you need some money, i could help paying a little i assume
2014 Jan 06 23:36 <Lurker69> ehats the #3301linux about, i mean how it defers form this one?
2014 Jan 06 23:36 <neferty> cheetahburn: it's fine
2014 Jan 06 23:36 <soulseekah> mdzhb: progress?
2014 Jan 06 23:36 <Ymgve> just wondering if 8xlarge would help
2014 Jan 06 23:36 <PersonalKilljoy> neferty: based on c100 how much time can algebra take in your opinion?
2014 Jan 06 23:36 <Ymgve> because I assume that will be a major bottleneck
2014 Jan 06 23:36 <soulseekah> you could look at htop
2014 Jan 06 23:36 <neferty> Ymgve: don't think so, but we can upgrade if needed
2014 Jan 06 23:36 <soulseekah> and see if cores are doing well
2014 Jan 06 23:37 <soulseekah> i.e. not only 1 ocre is loaded
2014 Jan 06 23:37 <neferty> PersonalKilljoy: i'm not very good at guessing... i'd say somewhere between 10-20 hours, but i'm really not the person to make such assumptions
2014 Jan 06 23:37 <PersonalKilljoy> yh ok
2014 Jan 06 23:38 <Ymgve> it took 26 hours for a 155digit number apparently
2014 Jan 06 23:38 <Ymgve> but that was on an 8x
2014 Jan 06 23:38 <neferty> c100 took ~1 hour on a pretty meh processor, this one's MUCH better, but as you probably know, computation doesn't scale linearly
2014 Jan 06 23:38 <cheetahburn> so i can safely go to bed, let the script run, and not miss a thing within the next 8 hours?
2014 Jan 06 23:38 <neferty> Ymgve: you mean someone else did it?
2014 Jan 06 23:38 <neferty> wait derp
2014 Jan 06 23:38 <neferty> i'm retarded
2014 Jan 06 23:38 <Ymgve> http://crypto.2013.rump.cr.yp.to/981774ce07e51813fd4466612a78601b.pdf
2014 Jan 06 23:39 <Ymgve> another number, but also on ec2
2014 Jan 06 23:39 <neferty> Ymgve: also, 8x isn't much better CPU wise, it's more memory and storage, mostly
2014 Jan 06 23:39 <mdzhb> my 16 extra cores are up
2014 Jan 06 23:39 <PersonalKilljoy> chunk 3 done
2014 Jan 06 23:40 <homevillageness> how far are we now?
2014 Jan 06 23:40 <neferty> Info:Lattice Sieving: Found 58083 relations in '/home/ubuntu/cicada_workdir/cicada.upload/cicada.sieving.24640000-24680000.hdflh8.gz', total is now 7074094/29000000
2014 Jan 06 23:40 <mdzhb> soulseekah: you can mod the instructions btw, it spawns 4 threads
2014 Jan 06 23:40 <mdzhb> i'm running it twice to saturate 8 cores
2014 Jan 06 23:41 <neferty> sieving is going much faster than i'd expected
2014 Jan 06 23:41 <cheetahburn> why did my server stop?
2014 Jan 06 23:41 <soulseekah> mdzhb: okay
2014 Jan 06 23:41 <lvkm> just finished 3 sets
2014 Jan 06 23:41 <brotherBox> is that a local or distributed thing neferty?
2014 Jan 06 23:41 <soulseekah> so run once per each 2 cores?
2014 Jan 06 23:41 <neferty> brotherBox: that's the server
2014 Jan 06 23:41 <neferty> meaning sieving is at 7M out of 29M
2014 Jan 06 23:42 <cheetahburn> my load dropped, but the program states to run sieving
2014 Jan 06 23:42 <mdzhb> soulseekah: per 4 even
2014 Jan 06 23:42 <gonflynn> Im stuck and going to try to fix it willl tell you when I'm ready
2014 Jan 06 23:42 <soulseekah> okay
2014 Jan 06 23:42 <Ymgve> how many clients approx are connected
2014 Jan 06 23:42 <soulseekah> mdzhb: understood
2014 Jan 06 23:42 <soulseekah> mdzhb: any broken clinets?
2014 Jan 06 23:42 <mdzhb> no seems quite okay
2014 Jan 06 23:43 <soulseekah> okay
2014 Jan 06 23:43 <cheetahburn> damnit i crashed

2014 Jan 06 23:48 <JustVisiting> Is it telling you that xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is doing 2444000 - 2448000? 
2014 Jan 06 23:49 <brotherBox> soulseekah, the way it looks, we could use the people who run Windows
2014 Jan 06 23:49 <soulseekah> no no
2014 Jan 06 23:49 <soulseekah> don't risk
2014 Jan 06 23:49 <soulseekah> fucking everything beacuse of bad client
2014 Jan 06 23:49 <soulseekah> we're unstable as is

2014 Jan 06 23:49 <homevillageness> does someone have another server to use?
2014 Jan 06 23:49 <soulseekah> mdzhb: IP blocked?
2014 Jan 06 23:49 <homevillageness> so that we can test stability
2014 Jan 06 23:50 <homevillageness> on that server
2014 Jan 06 23:50 <homevillageness> with a c90 run or something
2014 Jan 06 23:50 <homevillageness> and then if the group is stable, pass them to here?

2014 Jan 06 23:50 <soulseekah> ther's more work
2014 Jan 06 23:50 <brotherBox> soulseekah, could you preprare information just for patching, i.e., a pastebin just with compilation and pathing info?
2014 Jan 06 23:50 <soulseekah> brotherBox: I have a TAR.GZ ready to upload
2014 Jan 06 23:50 <soulseekah> hold on
2014 Jan 06 23:50 <soulseekah> will provide details
2014 Jan 06 23:51 <soulseekah> it's already patched
2014 Jan 06 23:51 <soulseekah> testing
2014 Jan 06 23:51 <brotherBox> Didn't know that, will hold them up
2014 Jan 06 23:51 <soulseekah> thanks
2014 Jan 06 23:51 <neferty> some derps are still trying to open it in a web browser
2014 Jan 06 23:51 <Ymgve> soulseekah: yeah but sieving will be done in like 6 hours anyway
2014 Jan 06 23:51 <soulseekah> Ymgve: better earlier than later
2014 Jan 06 23:51 <neferty> Ymgve: actually, sieving will be done much sooner i think
2014 Jan 06 23:51 <neferty> it's already nearly at 10M/27M
2014 Jan 06 23:51 <soulseekah> have the distributed part done over with
2014 Jan 06 23:51 <mdzhb> we'll probably need more sieving
2014 Jan 06 23:51 <Lurker69> can you invite monofree in #3301cado? he is in 3301linux too
2014 Jan 06 23:51 <neferty> but yeah mdzhb is right
2014 Jan 06 23:51 <Ymgve> true I guess but I'm more worried about the linear algebra stage
2014 Jan 06 23:51 <lvkm> when did we start? 1 hour ago?
2014 Jan 06 23:51 <mdzhb> so dont kill your clients once its out of work
2014 Jan 06 23:52 <JustVisiting> Why isn't everyone in #3301linux working on this?
2014 Jan 06 23:52 <soulseekah> understood
2014 Jan 06 23:52 <Ymgve> btw, does cado store a log anywhere
2014 Jan 06 23:52 <soulseekah> they're preparing
2014 Jan 06 23:52 <mdzhb> Ymgve: yup
2014 Jan 06 23:52 <Ymgve> where?
2014 Jan 06 23:52 <soulseekah> #3301linux is preparing newbs
2014 Jan 06 23:52 <mdzhb> or well, serverside
2014 Jan 06 23:52 <neferty> JustVisiting: due to possibilty of misconfiguration of their clients, and fucking up things
2014 Jan 06 23:52 <mdzhb> clientside i dont know

2014 Jan 06 23:52 <JustVisiting> Got it, neferty, soulseekah, thanx. :) 
2014 Jan 06 23:52 <Ymgve> well I mean serverside, I'm playing a bit around with it myself standalone
2014 Jan 06 23:52 * soulseekah sets mode: +o Lurker69
2014 Jan 06 23:52 <mdzhb> 10mil relations!
2014 Jan 06 23:52 <Lurker69> thx soulseekah
2014 Jan 06 23:52 <soulseekah> good
2014 Jan 06 23:52 <neferty> JustVisiting: WUs are set to 2 hours timeout, meaning if someone claims a WU, no one else is assigned that WU for 2 hours
2014 Jan 06 23:52 <mdzhb> 19 to go
2014 Jan 06 23:53 <JustVisiting> That's a huge timeout...
2014 Jan 06 23:53 <neferty> and if you grab a bunch of WUs with a bad client, you'll fuck us pretty good
2014 Jan 06 23:53 <mdzhb> its okay for this stage i think
2014 Jan 06 23:53 <brotherBox> I fucking love you people
2014 Jan 06 23:53 <gumpus> ok, i have an 8 core xeon, 2x4 core i7, 8 core FX working on this now
2014 Jan 06 23:53 <mdzhb> neferty: dont think it's an issue for sieving
2014 Jan 06 23:53 <neferty> JustVisiting: it's good for this stage
2014 Jan 06 23:53 <JustVisiting> I complete a WU in circa 25-30 minutes, and I'm running a 7 year old quad-core...
2014 Jan 06 23:53 <mdzhb> itll just spawn new work
2014 Jan 06 23:53 <mdzhb> ubudev.96251eb6L
2014 Jan 06 23:53 <mdzhb> broken
2014 Jan 06 23:53 <neferty> mdzhb: might be true... i still don't want bad clients stealing work though
2014 Jan 06 23:53 <mdzhb> agreed
2014 Jan 06 23:54 <brotherBox> soulseekah, how's that tar going?
2014 Jan 06 23:54 <trebla> if I just spawn 1 client it will fork and take 100% on all 4 cores anyway, during sieving
2014 Jan 06 23:54 <neferty> mdzhb: might not be broken, grabbed 6 WUs, and working now
2014 Jan 06 23:54 <lvkm> isn't it possible to reassign a WU manually?
2014 Jan 06 23:54 <eonn> finished 4 WUs
2014 Jan 06 23:54 <neferty> lvkm: it is, but it's tedious
2014 Jan 06 23:54 <mdzhb> neferty: oh, on 1 id?
2014 Jan 06 23:54 <mdzhb> ah yeah
2014 Jan 06 23:54 <mdzhb> that could work
2014 Jan 06 23:54 <mdzhb> i guess
2014 Jan 06 23:54 <mdzhb> :)
2014 Jan 06 23:55 <eonn> i fucking need a timestamp in the log -_-
2014 Jan 06 23:55 <homevillageness> mdzhb want to try to let me join again?
2014 Jan 06 23:55 <mdzhb> sure
2014 Jan 06 23:55 <monkeybear> just thinking the same about them timestamps
2014 Jan 06 23:55 <gumpus> neferty: by 'stealing work' do you mean that for some reason they don't execute las so they just loop sucking work out of server?
2014 Jan 06 23:55 <homevillageness> seems still bad
2014 Jan 06 23:55 <neferty> gumpus: exactly
2014 Jan 06 23:55 <gumpus> neferty: i ran into that problem about 2 hours ago when setting up cado server myself
2014 Jan 06 23:56 <gumpus> glad i found you people 
2014 Jan 06 23:56 <neferty> gumpus: a common mistake is that they don't copy some .so next to the binary, and it just keeps downloading WUs from the server, then the siever exits because it can't start without the .so
2014 Jan 06 23:56 <gumpus> yup, i fixed it with LD_LIBRARY_PATH
2014 Jan 06 23:56 <neferty> yeah taht works, but common folk don't know that :p
2014 Jan 06 23:56 <gumpus> that was on polyselect2l part though i didn't get as far as las 
2014 Jan 06 23:56 <gumpus> like i said.. glad i found you guys :) 
2014 Jan 06 23:57 <neferty> and we're glad to have your firepower under control ;)
2014 Jan 06 23:57 <soulseekah> done
2014 Jan 06 23:57 <soulseekah> brotherBox: taring is done

2014 Jan 06 23:57 <JustVisiting> WU9, yay.
2014 Jan 06 23:57 <gumpus> neferty: whta you mean?
2014 Jan 06 23:58 <gonflynn> nothing, I'm exhausted and am getting nowhere. going to sleep. See you guys tomorrow. Good luck.
2014 Jan 06 23:58 <neferty> gumpus: well you stated that you brought along a pretty impressive amount of computational power
2014 Jan 06 23:58 <JustVisiting> Nite.
2014 Jan 06 23:58 <PersonalKilljoy> hawker> i meant, how do we know that by factoring we will get only two primes 
2014 Jan 06 23:58 <PersonalKilljoy> this is getting better and better

2014 Jan 07 00:03 <brotherBox> Better question: how could you resist?
2014 Jan 07 00:03 <mdzhb> so, who's the sql wizard?

2014 Jan 07 00:06 <Ymgve> well it is, as long as you use it to run a VM

2014 Jan 07 00:07 <soulseekah> and make sure you don't fuck up
2014 Jan 07 00:07 <typhoid> tell me about bad clients pls what made them bad since they obviously arent windows machines

2014 Jan 07 00:23 <mdzhb> might be able to do the linalg step differently if needed
2014 Jan 07 00:23 <soulseekah> yeh
2014 Jan 07 00:23 <soulseekah> nacquiesce_: updaet plaease are you running a client?
2014 Jan 07 00:23 <trebla> mdzhb: i noticed on the test run that it only ran on the server, that was the krylov and mksol that took time to run
2014 Jan 07 00:23 <crazy> soulseekah, i succed to connect, but the python script return me some errors

2014 Jan 07 00:24 <soulseekah> crazy: what's the output of "make patch"?
2014 Jan 07 00:24 <mdzhb> but if heninger used mpi to parallelize it over 16 boxes, we're a few cores short
2014 Jan 07 00:24 <anon143243284> do rm download then mkdir download then make patch
2014 Jan 07 00:24 <anon143243284> i had the same issue
2014 Jan 07 00:24 <nacquiesce_> I am.  trying to connect server  now

2014 Jan 07 00:25 <neferty> mdzhb: i can upgrade to 8xlarge if you think that's going to help a lot
2014 Jan 07 00:25 <soulseekah> download contains important files to begin with
2014 Jan 07 00:25 <iuser_admin> oh, and I think there's a problem with the patcher
2014 Jan 07 00:25 <soulseekah> iuser_admin: pray tell
2014 Jan 07 00:25 <fdsfgs> soulseekah,  make patch does not create the download dir
2014 Jan 07 00:25 <iuser_admin> it made a in download called download and didn't actually put the required files in download
2014 Jan 07 00:25 <anon143243284> works like a charm here
2014 Jan 07 00:25 <mdzhb> neferty: she used mem. optimized large instacnes, not sure how many cores those have
2014 Jan 07 00:25 <soulseekah> fdsfgs: the DOWNLOAD dir already exists!
2014 Jan 07 00:25 <soulseekah> you odn't have to deleate it
2014 Jan 07 00:25 <iuser_admin> I had to rm -rf download and then run it again
2014 Jan 07 00:25 <crazy> soulseekah, no, now yes, it's working. sorry.
2014 Jan 07 00:25 <neferty> mdzhb: http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/
2014 Jan 07 00:25 <fdsfgs> my tar didn't bring the download folder
2014 Jan 07 00:26 <soulseekah> you can't rm downloat
2014 Jan 07 00:26 <soulseekah> fdsfgs: wrong tar then
2014 Jan 07 00:26 <soulseekah> no?
2014 Jan 07 00:26 <soulseekah> oh shit I forgot tar?
2014 Jan 07 00:26 <ne0_> doing what crazy said worked for me as well
2014 Jan 07 00:26 <anon143243284> probably
2014 Jan 07 00:26 <Ymgve> mdzhb: no, she didn't parallellize the linear algebra step, apart from running on a single ec2 instance
2014 Jan 07 00:26 <soulseekah> hold on
2014 Jan 07 00:26 <iuser_admin> it's working now (http://a.pomf.se/pnuejw.png), but it might confuse newcomers
2014 Jan 07 00:26 <malkuth> working now.
2014 Jan 07 00:26 <neferty> oh wow iuser_admin, nice one there
2014 Jan 07 00:27 <iuser_admin> I had a bunch of free AWS credit from a hackathon I didn't use
2014 Jan 07 00:27 <crazy> soulseekah, I  will also launch it on my other 8 CPUs server.
2014 Jan 07 00:27 <gonflynn> soulseekah, make patch is not working for mew
2014 Jan 07 00:28 <mdzhb> Ymgve: it says mpi parallelizable in the docs, sure that doesnt span over multiple hosts?
2014 Jan 07 00:28 <neferty> we're gonna be done sieving in an hour or two so i don't think we need to bring in any more people...
2014 Jan 07 00:28 <mdzhb> neferty: we'll need some more..
2014 Jan 07 00:28 <mdzhb> dont forget
2014 Jan 07 00:28 <soulseekah> hue
2014 Jan 07 00:28 <soulseekah> gonflynn: redownload the tar
2014 Jan 07 00:28 <soulseekah> ANYONE else with nonworking clients?
2014 Jan 07 00:28 <gonflynn> soulseekah i did
2014 Jan 07 00:28 <ne0_> i got mine working by doing what crazy said
2014 Jan 07 00:28 <neferty> mdzhb: true, true, but we just got 32 cores from iuser_admin, and god knows how many of the newcomers got on it too
2014 Jan 07 00:28 <soulseekah> gonflynn: DOWNLOAD THE TAR and start over
2014 Jan 07 00:29 <gonflynn> ok, i know, didn't delete last
2014 Jan 07 00:29 <mdzhb> neferty: oh :D
2014 Jan 07 00:29 <gonflynn> sorry
2014 Jan 07 00:29 <brotherBox> soulseekah, in #3301linux we have people who are concerned about what they are downloading and if we hid something nasty in there
2014 Jan 07 00:29 <soulseekah> brotherBox: tell them to read the sources
2014 Jan 07 00:29 <Ymgve> mdzhb: if it did, I'm not sure why she would write _partially_ parallel in the presentation
2014 Jan 07 00:29 <brotherBox> It would be great if you could document the changes you made if you remember
2014 Jan 07 00:29 <soulseekah> brotherBox: I don't give a fuck
2014 Jan 07 00:29 <mdzhb> Ymgve: fair enough

2014 Jan 07 00:43 <JustVisiting> Just got new jobs.
2014 Jan 07 00:44 <gonflynn> error $)$: No work available
2014 Jan 07 00:44 <gonflynn> 404
2014 Jan 07 00:44 <soulseekah> please be patient
2014 Jan 07 00:44 <eonn> 404 is proberbly ok
2014 Jan 07 00:44 <gonflynn> ok
2014 Jan 07 00:44 <monkeybear> yeah, just got assigned a new WU
2014 Jan 07 00:44 <tsenart> uff, at least my uploads succeeded
2014 Jan 07 00:44 <soulseekah> keep your clients running
2014 Jan 07 00:44 <gonflynn> going at it again, lets see
2014 Jan 07 00:45 <eonn> okay, do we inform 3301linux?
2014 Jan 07 00:45 <mdzhb> it'll crash again
2014 Jan 07 00:45 <tsenart> resumed
2014 Jan 07 00:45 <brotherBox> eonn, about what?
2014 Jan 07 00:45 * typhoid was kicked by soulseekah (typhoid)
2014 Jan 07 00:45 <brotherBox> hue
2014 Jan 07 00:45 <neferty> gonflynn: stop, your client is bad
2014 Jan 07 00:45 <soulseekah> gonflynn: I told you
2014 Jan 07 00:45 <soulseekah> gonflynn: stop as is
2014 Jan 07 00:45 <lvkm> mdzhb, do you think the server will accept the WU from the clients after going up?
2014 Jan 07 00:45 <soulseekah> rm -rf download
2014 Jan 07 00:46 <gonflynn> stopped
2014 Jan 07 00:46 <eonn> about the downtime ?
2014 Jan 07 00:46 <soulseekah> mkdir -p download
2014 Jan 07 00:46 <soulseekah> make patch
2014 Jan 07 00:46 <gonflynn> what happened?
2014 Jan 07 00:46 <mdzhb> hmm
2014 Jan 07 00:46 <soulseekah> wget http://codeseekah.com/cicada/cicada.polyselect.poly -O download/cicada.polyselect.poly
2014 Jan 07 00:46 <soulseekah> wget http://codeseekah.com/cicada/cicada.factorbase.roots.gz -O download/cicada.factorbase.roots.gz
2014 Jan 07 00:46 <JustVisiting> I should go to sleep. If I just leave clients running, will they resume work on their own, soulseekah, when server is back up?
2014 Jan 07 00:46 <soulseekah> and that
2014 Jan 07 00:46 <soulseekah> gonflynn: are you following?
2014 Jan 07 00:46 <soulseekah> JustVisiting: yes
2014 Jan 07 00:46 <gonflynn> yes
2014 Jan 07 00:46 <gonflynn> ok
2014 Jan 07 00:46 <eonn> yes keep running
2014 Jan 07 00:46 <JustVisiting> Aight.
2014 Jan 07 00:47 <soulseekah> getting gonflynn fixed
2014 Jan 07 00:47 <JustVisiting> So gnite then, will check tomorrow.
2014 Jan 07 00:47 <lvkm> so it wasn't tested yet :(
2014 Jan 07 00:47 <soulseekah> JustVisiting: nite
2014 Jan 07 00:47 <lvkm> but for next time we'll know
2014 Jan 07 00:47 <JustVisiting> Good luck, boys and girls. soulseekah get some rest too man, you need it after 24 hours!
2014 Jan 07 00:47 <soulseekah> Anyone else with clients that are not FROZEN in time and fans that are not spining?!
2014 Jan 07 00:47 <brotherBox> Can't confirm this
2014 Jan 07 00:48 <soulseekah> If your fans are not spinnig, and your output in clients is not frozen on one line for 5-10 minutes then you're doing something wrong!!!!!!! Stop now!
2014 Jan 07 00:48 <n0rv> I need some sleep, so bye. cado still works.
2014 Jan 07 00:48 <soulseekah> mdzhb: any other bad clients?
2014 Jan 07 00:48 <eonn> don't panic
2014 Jan 07 00:48 <eonn> bro :D
2014 Jan 07 00:48 <soulseekah> n0rv: please chekc your output before going
2014 Jan 07 00:48 <soulseekah> n0rv: is it really working stuck on one thing?
2014 Jan 07 00:49 <mdzhb> so erm
2014 Jan 07 00:49 <mdzhb> bad hack
2014 Jan 07 00:49 <mdzhb> but this should 'work'
2014 Jan 07 00:49 <iuser_admin> soulseekah: you don't need to wget those
2014 Jan 07 00:49 <n0rv> it sent something already and I have ~97% cpu usage al the time
2014 Jan 07 00:49 <iuser_admin> the client script gets the automatically
2014 Jan 07 00:49 <soulseekah> iuser_admin: nope, we tested 100 times
2014 Jan 07 00:49 <M3N74L157> what are the ram requirements for the client? can I run it in a virtual machine?
2014 Jan 07 00:49 <soulseekah> M3N74L157: you can
2014 Jan 07 00:50 <M3N74L157> ho much should I assign?
2014 Jan 07 00:50 <soulseekah> all of it
2014 Jan 07 00:50 <soulseekah> it's not memory intensive btw
2014 Jan 07 00:50 * Quits: ausdorff (~homevilla@gateway/tor-sasl/homevillageness) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2014 Jan 07 00:50 <iuser_admin> mine got it automatically
2014 Jan 07 00:50 <soulseekah> I'm using like 1G
2014 Jan 07 00:50 <soulseekah> iuser_admin: that's good to know
2014 Jan 07 00:50 <soulseekah> but gonflynn's didin't
2014 Jan 07 00:50 <iuser_admin> okay
2014 Jan 07 00:50 <soulseekah> so just to make sure
2014 Jan 07 00:50 * Quits: fl1pflop (~fl1pflop@2a02:810c:340:15fc:213e:b135:720b:5a84) (Quit: fl1pflop)
2014 Jan 07 00:51 <soulseekah> iuser_admin: I think that first time hosts
2014 Jan 07 00:51 <soulseekah> will get those
2014 Jan 07 00:51 <soulseekah> not sure
2014 Jan 07 00:51 <soulseekah> Anyone else with clients not running?
2014 Jan 07 00:51 <iuser_admin> well yeah, I only had to do it once
2014 Jan 07 00:51 <M3N74L157> cado takes ages.to install.
2014 Jan 07 00:51 <trebla> mdzhb: it looks like uploads are working again
2014 Jan 07 00:51 <soulseekah> M3N74L157: what pastebin are you following?
2014 Jan 07 00:51 <mdzhb> trebla: yup
2014 Jan 07 00:52 <trebla> good work
2014 Jan 07 00:52 <M3N74L157> the one in the topic?
2014 Jan 07 00:52 <soulseekah> okay
2014 Jan 07 00:52 <C_I_C> mine is sitting at http://pastebin.com/P4RnKgtQ  frozen or no?
2014 Jan 07 00:52 <nacquiesce_> ugh, can I query someone please regarding client issues?
2014 Jan 07 00:52 <soulseekah> C_I_C: looks good
2014 Jan 07 00:52 <gonflynn> i get an error for  no such file or directory ....sievinf.60680000-60720000.gz
2014 Jan 07 00:52 <soulseekah> nacquiesce_: query me
2014 Jan 07 00:52 <eonn> fans are running, 4 las processes, cpu 100%
2014 Jan 07 00:52 <C_I_C> good good
2014 Jan 07 00:53 <soulseekah> gonflynn: did it freeze?
2014 Jan 07 00:53 <gonflynn> IOError
2014 Jan 07 00:53 <soulseekah> is it still running?
2014 Jan 07 00:53 <gonflynn> nah, just stops 
2014 Jan 07 00:53 <soulseekah> wtf
2014 Jan 07 00:53 <soulseekah> remove all .gz files
2014 Jan 07 00:54 <soulseekah> and try again
2014 Jan 07 00:54 <gonflynn> ok
2014 Jan 07 00:54 <soulseekah> looking good eh
2014 Jan 07 00:54 <tsenart> Is there an planned asynchronous way of sharing the results in case any of us isn't here at the time?
2014 Jan 07 00:55 <OwariDa> for the worried ones, this is the diff between the original cado-nfs and the one provided by soulseekah: http://pastebin.com/VnKSm0v7
2014 Jan 07 00:55 <soulseekah> tsenart: no
2014 Jan 07 00:55 <soulseekah> OwariDa: oh htanks
2014 Jan 07 00:55 <n0rv> soulseekah: sending next results
2014 Jan 07 00:55 <mdzhb> i bbl for real now
2014 Jan 07 00:55 <tsenart> soulseekah: No? Perhaps we can think of one?
2014 Jan 07 00:55 <soulseekah> brotherBox: ^^^^^^^
2014 Jan 07 00:56 <soulseekah> tsenart: why are you so worried
2014 Jan 07 00:56 <tsenart> soulseekah: I am all but worried. I am excited :)
2014 Jan 07 00:56 <anon143243284> i share his view
2014 Jan 07 00:56 <OwariDa> it's only the patches that were manually applied in the original pastebin, + the cicada.polysect.poly and cicada.factorbase.roots.gz files added.
2014 Jan 07 00:56 <GeorgeCostanza> He has a legitimate concern. 
2014 Jan 07 00:56 <soulseekah> anon143243284: 2 people have access to the server
2014 Jan 07 00:56 <anon143243284> maybe pone can distribute the results over the clients once found
2014 Jan 07 00:56 <soulseekah> mdzhb and neferty 
2014 Jan 07 00:56 <anon143243284> *one
2014 Jan 07 00:57 <brotherBox> soulseekah, wot
2014 Jan 07 00:57 <soulseekah> anon143243284: no you can't
2014 Jan 07 00:57 <soulseekah> brotherBox: see above
2014 Jan 07 00:57 <soulseekah> 05:52 < OwariDa> for the worried ones, this is the diff between the original cado-nfs and the one provided by soulseekah: http://pastebin.com/VnKSm0v7
2014 Jan 07 00:57 <tsenart> But I want to go to sleep... And I'd like to be updated via a less ephemeral medium than IRC, given the effort we're all putting into this.
2014 Jan 07 00:57 <soulseekah> tsenart: read the wikia when you wake up
2014 Jan 07 00:57 <gumpus> someone will edit wiki 
2014 Jan 07 00:57 <soulseekah> nobody's gonna hide anything
2014 Jan 07 00:57 <tsenart> Great
2014 Jan 07 00:57 <soulseekah> this is a collective effort
2014 Jan 07 00:57 <neferty> i'll put it on the wiki once we factored it
2014 Jan 07 00:57 <soulseekah> results will be published immediately
2014 Jan 07 00:57 <soulseekah> (or so I trust)
2014 Jan 07 00:57 <C_I_C> hmmm
2014 Jan 07 00:57 <neferty> or mdzhb might, one of us for sure
2014 Jan 07 00:57 <GeorgeCostanza> Trust nobody.
2014 Jan 07 00:57 <OwariDa> (note that the diff i provided can't be applied as a patch, due to the cicada.factorbase.roots.gz file that it only says is a binary file)
2014 Jan 07 00:58 <C_I_C> if only there was a service we could setup that one person who hang out all time, when something big goes down our any new developments. it sends a mass text
2014 Jan 07 00:58 <C_I_C> thatd be baller as fuck
2014 Jan 07 00:58 <Lurker69> ahm, is this OK or shall i keep it secret?
2014 Jan 07 00:58 <Lurker69> http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/CICADA_3301_2014_PUZZLE#FACTORIZING_n_FOR_REAL
2014 Jan 07 00:58 <soulseekah> OwariDa: actually 
2014 Jan 07 00:59 <soulseekah> OwariDa: it can't
2014 Jan 07 00:59 <soulseekah> because downloads vs download
2014 Jan 07 00:59 <Lurker69> also if anything is worng pls help to say it better
2014 Jan 07 00:59 <soulseekah> I had the wrong dir name
2014 Jan 07 00:59 <soulseekah> it's 6AM here sorry
2014 Jan 07 00:59 <soulseekah> can't get shit right anymore
2014 Jan 07 00:59 <neferty> Lurker69: please blur out pastebin and server address
2014 Jan 07 00:59 <soulseekah> it's fixed
2014 Jan 07 00:59 <brotherBox> Has anyone compiled this on x86 machines?
2014 Jan 07 00:59 <Lurker69> ok
2014 Jan 07 00:59 <trebla> Lurker69: just dont post the ip, somebody can connect with a bad client and mess things up
2014 Jan 07 00:59 <iuser_admin> brotherBox: I don't think anyone's compiled it on a machine that isn't x86
2014 Jan 07 00:59 <Lurker69> yaya
2014 Jan 07 01:00 <tsenart> Lurker69: And do it fast...
2014 Jan 07 01:00 <neferty> okay guys, we're at 27,5M/29M, but we do expect the total number of relations to increase
2014 Jan 07 01:00 <soulseekah> do x86 machines even exist naymore?
2014 Jan 07 01:00 <brotherBox> Apparently
2014 Jan 07 01:00 <soulseekah> sweet
2014 Jan 07 01:00 <iuser_admin> x86 machines are what every personal computer is
2014 Jan 07 01:00 <soulseekah> then yes
2014 Jan 07 01:01 <soulseekah> it compiles on them
2014 Jan 07 01:01 <eonn> didn't noticed that: the site gives a 403 forbidden. Telnet didn't give anything either. A hosting report gave the info that the server is located on a german hosting service.
2014 Jan 07 01:01 <eonn>  :O
2014 Jan 07 01:01 <iuser_admin> indeed it does
2014 Jan 07 01:01 <soulseekah> eonn: wat site?
2014 Jan 07 01:01 <eonn> http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/CICADA_3301_2014_PUZZLE#FACTORIZING_n_FOR_REAL
2014 Jan 07 01:01 <soulseekah> Anyone still not running their clients?!
2014 Jan 07 01:01 <eonn> the latest posts
2014 Jan 07 01:01 * Joins: ilovebooze420 (45f6c137@gateway/web/freenode/ip.69.246.193.55)
2014 Jan 07 01:02 <n0rv> how many clients running?
2014 Jan 07 01:02 <gonflynn> looks like its working now
2014 Jan 07 01:02 <soulseekah> eonn: no offtop, intersting as it may be
2014 Jan 07 01:02 <soulseekah> gonflynn: are you sure it's frozen on one line for 5-10 minutes?
2014 Jan 07 01:02 <gonflynn> still loading i think
2014 Jan 07 01:02 * Quits: lvkm (~isti@p4FDC634D.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (*.net *.split)
2014 Jan 07 01:03 <neferty> gonflynn: no it isn't
2014 Jan 07 01:03 <eonn> yeah sry, but it was really interesting ^^
2014 Jan 07 01:03 <neferty> gonflynn: stop it, and fix ur client
2014 Jan 07 01:03 <gonflynn> Segmentation fault
2014 Jan 07 01:03 <gonflynn> or something
2014 Jan 07 01:03 <soulseekah> gonflynn: congraulations
2014 Jan 07 01:03 <soulseekah> you're one of the unlucky few
2014 Jan 07 01:03 <gumpus> VM segfaults?
2014 Jan 07 01:03 <gonflynn> what IS wrong? 
2014 Jan 07 01:03 <soulseekah> that get segfaults

2014 Jan 07 01:03 <soulseekah> we can't help
2014 Jan 07 01:03 <eonn> yeah  in my client everything seems to be okay
2014 Jan 07 01:03 <soulseekah> Your job is done. Thank you for your services.
2014 Jan 07 01:03 <gumpus> what cflags does it build with? 
2014 Jan 07 01:04 <ilovebooze420> i got it working properly on a Pentoo VM. might we suggest people dl and run that in a VM if it must be run in a VM?
2014 Jan 07 01:04 <soulseekah> ilovebooze420: no idea
2014 Jan 07 01:04 <soulseekah> some vms work others don't
2014 Jan 07 01:04 * GeorgeCostanza is now known as Cyprus
2014 Jan 07 01:04 <soulseekah> my vPS didn't work for the las step
2014 Jan 07 01:04 <gonflynn> Think changing computer might work? Other linux is on VM
2014 Jan 07 01:04 <ilovebooze420> its working fine for me in VMWare Workstation 10.0
2014 Jan 07 01:04 <gonflynn> ill do it there
2014 Jan 07 01:04 <eonn> i had connection refused messages but no other errors
2014 Jan 07 01:04 <HereticLocke> Anyone running on CentOS, third time asking?
2014 Jan 07 01:04 <eonn> just got new work
2014 Jan 07 01:05 <soulseekah> new work

2014 Jan 07 01:05 <eonn> ah i had a failed upload
2014 Jan 07 01:05 <soulseekah> will reup
2014 Jan 07 01:05 <eonn> yep successfully reuped
2014 Jan 07 01:06 <eonn> everything seem to work like a charm
2014 Jan 07 01:06 <soulseekah> Anyone with clients not running well? Fans not spinning out of control?
2014 Jan 07 01:06 <soulseekah> brotherBox: how is linux chan doing?
2014 Jan 07 01:06 <soulseekah> Any more peeople?
2014 Jan 07 01:06 <brotherBox> Actually kind of okay
2014 Jan 07 01:06 <brotherBox> 62 people
2014 Jan 07 01:06 <tsenart> Signing off guys from IRC, leaving the clients running. Great team work!
2014 Jan 07 01:06 <soulseekah> why not joining
2014 Jan 07 01:07 <brotherBox> Helping a lot via query
2014 Jan 07 01:07 <soulseekah> tsenart: thanks bye
2014 Jan 07 01:07 <soulseekah> brotherBox: k
2014 Jan 07 01:07 <neferty> the server stopped
2014 Jan 07 01:07 <brotherBox> I give them invites to here
2014 Jan 07 01:07 <eonn> just keep your clients running...everything is okay
2014 Jan 07 01:07 <neferty> gimme a second let me check out what happened
2014 Jan 07 01:07 <ilovebooze420> its RAPING my cpu lol. guess that means its working ok
2014 Jan 07 01:07 <brotherBox> If they join...well...
2014 Jan 07 01:07 <iII> huh, vmware is on 10 now? I wonder if that's my issue lol
2014 Jan 07 01:07 <soulseekah> neferty: recoverable?
2014 Jan 07 01:07 <neferty> probably
2014 Jan 07 01:07 <soulseekah> good thing I got my work just now
2014 Jan 07 01:07 <soulseekah> means 10 minutes and I can submit
2014 Jan 07 01:08 <neferty> we're past 29M relations guys
2014 Jan 07 01:08 -soulseekah:#3301cado- Server is temporarily down... be patient.
2014 Jan 07 01:08 <neferty> duplicate removal is in progress
2014 Jan 07 01:08 <eonn> yeah i got my work too, client maybe won't recognize the downtime
2014 Jan 07 01:08 <soulseekah> neferty: oh stopped != crashed?
2014 Jan 07 01:08 <neferty> well, no, i meant crashed
2014 Jan 07 01:08 <soulseekah> oh
2014 Jan 07 01:09 <ilovebooze420> i want to see these numbers change occasionally, correct? cicada.sieving.66480000-66520000
2014 Jan 07 01:09 <iuser_admin> what happens if a job finishes and the server's not there to receive it?
2014 Jan 07 01:10 <VBFH> upload will fail
2014 Jan 07 01:10 <soulseekah> it will try again later
2014 Jan 07 01:10 <neferty> iuser_admin: ^, but it's stored
2014 Jan 07 01:10 <iuser_admin> it'll keep retrying, right?
2014 Jan 07 01:10 <iuser_admin> yeah
2014 Jan 07 01:10 <VBFH> oh, ok
2014 Jan 07 01:10 <VBFH> good
2014 Jan 07 01:10 <iuser_admin> I suppose doing anything but that would be silly
2014 Jan 07 01:10 <eonn> great setup guys :)
2014 Jan 07 01:10 <trebla> ah, then the worst part is over, after the first duplicate removal the intervals get shorter and shorter, until the sieving is done
2014 Jan 07 01:10 <soulseekah> neferty: ETA on fix?
2014 Jan 07 01:11 <neferty> this doesn't look good... but progress is not lost for sure
2014 Jan 07 01:11 <neferty> there's something wrong with duplicate check
2014 Jan 07 01:11 <soulseekah> please let us know who ran the bad client
2014 Jan 07 01:11 <trebla> :(
2014 Jan 07 01:11 <soulseekah> so we can fix/kick asap
2014 Jan 07 01:12 <iuser_admin> okay, uploads failing now

2014 Jan 07 01:13 <soulseekah> brotherBox: downtime
2014 Jan 07 01:13 <OwariDa> soulseekah: what did you mean by actually it can't because downloads vs download? the cicada.polysect.poly file is in the downloads directory as well, but is included in the diff since it's a text file. but for the gz file diff -urN just says Binary files cado-nfs-2.0-new/downloads/cicada.factorbase.roots.gz and cado-nfs-2.0-org/downloads/cicada.factorbase.roots.gz differ
2014 Jan 07 01:13 <soulseekah> OwariDa: I mean I screwed up the directory names
2014 Jan 07 01:14 <soulseekah> OwariDa: so when you apply the patch the directory is incorrect
2014 Jan 07 01:14 <iuser_admin> actually, only $2.40
2014 Jan 07 01:14 <soulseekah> iuser_admin: I don't have a card I can trust them with

2014 Jan 07 01:14 <soulseekah> looks really useufl
2014 Jan 07 01:14 <iuser_admin> I'm just running off of some AWS credit I got from a hackathon
2014 Jan 07 01:15 <soulseekah> oh nice
2014 Jan 07 01:15 <crazy> I added another 8 cores (16 cores on my side)

2014 Jan 07 01:15 <OwariDa> soulseekah: that's actually what i said as well (that it can't be applied as a patch), but for a different reason. ;) just put it up there so people could verify the changes you made. :)
2014 Jan 07 01:15 <lvkm> hi
2014 Jan 07 01:15 <iuser_admin> no idea. just tells me connection refused
2014 Jan 07 01:15 <soulseekah> that was a long split
2014 Jan 07 01:16 <soulseekah> OwariDa: yes, and for that I thank you much
2014 Jan 07 01:16 <lvkm> now i got 4 times connection refused for uploads

2014 Jan 07 01:20 <C_I_C> with the server being down, should my cpu be low?

2014 Jan 07 01:24 <soulseekah> for whoever was responsible
2014 Jan 07 01:25 <soulseekah> cuz we can't have such long downtimes anymore

2014 Jan 07 01:27 <soulseekah> gonflynn: you shouldn't be running anymore

2014 Jan 07 01:28 <eonn> soulseekah> hopefully it wasn't you <- do you meen me?
2014 Jan 07 01:28 <neferty> you were just stealing work, not completing it or returning it

2014 Jan 07 01:29 <soulseekah> brotherBox: I don't know why that's happening
2014 Jan 07 01:29 <fdsfgs> check if download is a file or a folder
2014 Jan 07 01:29 <HereticLocke> brotherBox: I rm download but then soulseekah hours later told me my client had errors so I had to re-compile
2014 Jan 07 01:30 <soulseekah> brotherBox: have them redownload the tar

2014 Jan 07 01:38 <eonn> 1/4 no work availabile 
2014 Jan 07 01:38 <malkuth> looks like the program deletes old workfiles if you leave it running; I lost one of my two units. is there any way to recover the work, or will the work files just be re-run?
2014 Jan 07 01:38 <cornercase> just to be sure, how can I check that my client is not bad?
2014 Jan 07 01:39 <mdzhb> eonn: yes
2014 Jan 07 01:39 <eonn> there is a parameter...keepoldfiles ..isn't it?

2014 Jan 07 01:39 <soulseekah> please
2014 Jan 07 01:39 <Cyprus> It should delete the workfile after it is uploaded, then replace it with the next one that needs to be worked on.

2014 Jan 07 01:40 <mdzhb> we had 6 bad gzips out of 547 though
2014 Jan 07 01:40 <eonn> okay because one of my clients have no work anymore, i could restart it with keepoldfiles parameter
2014 Jan 07 01:40 <mdzhb> which caused it to crash and burn
2014 Jan 07 01:41 <eonn> or am i wrong?
2014 Jan 07 01:41 <soulseekah> eonn: don't risk
2014 Jan 07 01:41 <soulseekah> let's just run to the end
2014 Jan 07 01:41 <Ymgve> mdzhb: incomplete I guess?
2014 Jan 07 01:41 <malkuth> no timestamps in the output, it may have uploaded, then cleaned up. unclear from output. let me know if you want the work file range if you are able to check to see if it is still allocated to someone, or complete

2014 Jan 07 01:43 <apx> \o/
2014 Jan 07 01:43 <soulseekah> wait for work
2014 Jan 07 01:43 <soulseekah> gonflynn: yes
2014 Jan 07 01:43 <gonflynn> k
2014 Jan 07 01:43 <soulseekah> Clients on standby waiting for more work
2014 Jan 07 01:43 <HereticLocke> 404
2014 Jan 07 01:43 <soulseekah> ...
2014 Jan 07 01:43 <soulseekah> yes
2014 Jan 07 01:43 <HereticLocke> Sorry, just updating
2014 Jan 07 01:43 <cornercase> I'm waiting for work, but would like to check if my client is bad or not.  Any method for this?
2014 Jan 07 01:43 <soulseekah> cornercase: how long have you been running it?
2014 Jan 07 01:44 <soulseekah> cornercase: have you fans been spinning crazy? CPU 100% load?
2014 Jan 07 01:44 <brotherBox> Ohai cornercase 
2014 Jan 07 01:44 <mdzhb> does anyone have an old server log?
2014 Jan 07 01:44 <mdzhb> brotherBox: ?
2014 Jan 07 01:44 <neferty> okay guys, we're in Singleton removal, after this you might get more 
2014 Jan 07 01:44 <neferty> mdzhb: i do
2014 Jan 07 01:44 <brotherBox> What does that mean
2014 Jan 07 01:44 <cornercase> I started about 1.5 hours ago, my CPUs were pegged
2014 Jan 07 01:44 <soulseekah> cornercase: then you're fine
2014 Jan 07 01:45 <cornercase> ok, cool
2014 Jan 07 01:45 <trebla> brotherBox: that is the phase after duplicate removal
2014 Jan 07 01:45 <trebla> brotherBox: then it begins a new iteration
2014 Jan 07 01:45 <ilovebooze420> still waiting for work. :(
2014 Jan 07 01:45 <trebla> of sieving
2014 Jan 07 01:45 <soulseekah> ilovebooze420: patience
2014 Jan 07 01:45 <trebla> ilovebooze420: after singleton removal is finished
2014 Jan 07 01:45 <neferty> it will LIKELY do more sieving
2014 Jan 07 01:45 <ilovebooze420> just mentioning it soulseekah. no hurry :)
2014 Jan 07 01:45 <neferty> but we don't know how much more
2014 Jan 07 01:45 <neferty> it might be 0, it might be another 29M
2014 Jan 07 01:45 <trebla> k
2014 Jan 07 01:45 <brotherBox> ^
2014 Jan 07 01:46 <brotherBox> I need to sleep guys
2014 Jan 07 01:46 <soulseekah> go
2014 Jan 07 01:46 <soulseekah> Thanks for your hard work, bro.

2014 Jan 07 01:47 <brotherBox> Shamir is god
2014 Jan 07 01:48 -soulseekah:#3301cado- Please keep your clients running... work might be available soon, we need you all!
2014 Jan 07 01:48 <mdzhb> i dont think there will be any more work
2014 Jan 07 01:48 <neferty> no, after merging is done, the linalg process will being, which will likely take a couple hours, that is servside only
2014 Jan 07 01:48 <soulseekah> no more work?
2014 Jan 07 01:48 <soulseekah> sure?
2014 Jan 07 01:48 <neferty> please do not shut off your workers for now though
2014 Jan 07 01:48 <soulseekah> iuser_admin: you can shut off yours
2014 Jan 07 01:48 <gonflynn> k
2014 Jan 07 01:48 <soulseekah> don't want to be spending that much
2014 Jan 07 01:48 <soulseekah> 48 cores
2014 Jan 07 01:49 <soulseekah> idling
2014 Jan 07 01:49 <neferty> but yeah... i guess that's expensive as fuck
2014 Jan 07 01:49 <mdzhb> we're pretty sure we're done
2014 Jan 07 01:49 <soulseekah> Thank you all guys
2014 Jan 07 01:49 <JustVisiting> Congrats everyone!
2014 Jan 07 01:49 <soulseekah> Hang around and expect results
2014 Jan 07 01:49 <brotherBox> So I can go to bed, knowing that this was a success?
2014 Jan 07 01:49 <fdsfgs> :D
2014 Jan 07 01:49 <HereticLocke> :)
2014 Jan 07 01:49 <JustVisiting> brotherBox, same reason I didn't go to bed yet. :) 
2014 Jan 07 01:49 <soulseekah> I guess we can -i now?
2014 Jan 07 01:49 <mdzhb> merge will take up to an hour
2014 Jan 07 01:49 <gonflynn> so should i disconnect now?
2014 Jan 07 01:49 <ilovebooze420> this is awesome news people. glad i could help for as little as i helped! :)
2014 Jan 07 01:49 <brotherBox> JustVisiting, but I started this ;)
2014 Jan 07 01:49 <mdzhb> then it should start linalg
2014 Jan 07 01:49 <soulseekah> gonflynn: yes
2014 Jan 07 01:49 <gonflynn> cool
2014 Jan 07 01:49 <brotherBox> Shit guy
2014 Jan 07 01:49 <brotherBox> s
2014 Jan 07 01:50 <neferty> soulseekah: no, keep +i for now
2014 Jan 07 01:50 <JustVisiting> brotherBox, well yea, but where would starters be without visitors? :)
2014 Jan 07 01:50 <brotherBox> think about it
2014 Jan 07 01:50 <brotherBox> Distributed fucking factorization
2014 Jan 07 01:50 <gonflynn> Im going to bed. Will check tomorrow morning
2014 Jan 07 01:50 <lvkm> lin alg is serverside only, too?
2014 Jan 07 01:50 <brotherBox> Just in half a day
2014 Jan 07 01:50 <gonflynn> good luck
2014 Jan 07 01:50 -soulseekah:#3301cado- You can stop your clients now. Good work. Cicada is proud of you.

2014 Jan 07 01:50 <JustVisiting> good night, brother box! :) 
2014 Jan 07 01:50 <trebla> \o/
2014 Jan 07 01:50 <ilovebooze420> im gonna hang around. i want to hear results! thanks for letting me be a part of this
2014 Jan 07 01:50 <mdzhb> do stick around for the primes ;) but that might take a good while
2014 Jan 07 01:50 <Kerash> Goodnight everyone.
2014 Jan 07 01:51 <soulseekah> I think we can get a good 6-8 hours of sleep before primes emerge eh?
2014 Jan 07 01:51 <neferty> you guys can go to bed, and as soon as we have primes we'll post them here and on wiki

2014 Jan 07 01:52 <brotherBox> Don't kid me guys
2014 Jan 07 01:52 <eonn> great people...great effort :)
2014 Jan 07 01:52 <brotherBox> I will go postal on your ass
2014 Jan 07 01:52 <fdsfgs> what
2014 Jan 07 01:52 <soulseekah> so yes
2014 Jan 07 01:52 <mancha> i would assume something like 3-4 days :)
2014 Jan 07 01:52 <ilovebooze420> im not going to bed. its only 8pm here!
2014 Jan 07 01:52 <brotherBox> Its 2am here, I probably will
2014 Jan 07 01:52 -soulseekah:#3301cado- mad props to mdzhb, trebla, neferty and brotherBox for effort on the server side!
2014 Jan 07 01:52 <soulseekah> it's 7AM here
2014 Jan 07 01:52 <eonn> 1:52am... sitting on cado since 14pm :P
2014 Jan 07 01:52 <brotherBox> Thanks to you soulseekah. Its great to work with you.
2014 Jan 07 01:53 <lvkm> i'm going to sleep, cya later

2014 Jan 07 01:53 <exa> thanks to everyone :)
2014 Jan 07 01:53 <trebla> thanks everybody!
2014 Jan 07 01:53 <brotherBox> Whats the most realistic ETA we have?
2014 Jan 07 01:53 <ilovebooze420> gnight brotherBox. this is awesome
2014 Jan 07 01:53 <mdzhb> seeing matrix merge didnt take an hour (slides), i guess we might be lucky on the linalg part
2014 Jan 07 01:53 <trebla> brotherBox: I guess about 12 hours, at least
2014 Jan 07 01:53 <mdzhb> the bad news is, linalg doesn't parallelize at all. might be missing settings for MPI support
2014 Jan 07 01:53 <trebla> but it might be less
2014 Jan 07 01:53 <brotherBox> I see. Good night then, people. Its been a pleasure.
2014 Jan 07 01:54 <mdzhb> so i guess it'll be a couple of hours

2014 Jan 07 01:55 <soulseekah> nice
2014 Jan 07 01:55 <soulseekah> how many cores?
2014 Jan 07 01:55 <soulseekah> 42?
2014 Jan 07 01:55 <trebla> good night everybody
2014 Jan 07 01:55 <fdsfgs> good night :)

2014 Jan 07 01:57 <soulseekah> but there will be a new channel for it for sure
2014 Jan 07 01:57 <Lurker69> soulseekah: i am sending people who want to join in #3301linux, it that alright?
2014 Jan 07 01:57 <cornercase> I've got access to a 24 core Xeon server that's completely unutilized right now
2014 Jan 07 01:58 <soulseekah> Lurker69: not needed anymore
2014 Jan 07 01:58 <monofree> someone tell linux chan what's going on, so they won't think that they have been used

2014 Jan 07 01:58 <cornercase> just thinking about the future ...
2014 Jan 07 01:58 <soulseekah> Yes basically we're all waiting on the server
2014 Jan 07 01:58 <soulseekah> to complete the final bits of the algorithm

2014 Jan 07 02:00 <n0rv> someone should tell people on #33012014 about it... it think
2014 Jan 07 02:00 <soulseekah> Again, thank you all for supporting this crazy stuff
2014 Jan 07 02:00 <mancha> wow. sieving is the most time intensive step. and that's done already!
2014 Jan 07 02:00 <brotherBox> No.
2014 Jan 07 02:00 <soulseekah> Everyone will know from wikia
2014 Jan 07 02:00 <soulseekah> There's no hiding
2014 Jan 07 02:00 <soulseekah> unless mdzhb and neferty decide to bail on us
2014 Jan 07 02:00 <soulseekah> :D
2014 Jan 07 02:01 <Reticuli1> Do it fair and atleast share with people who has contributed
2014 Jan 07 02:01 <neferty> he's kidding, don't worry
2014 Jan 07 02:01 <soulseekah> :D
2014 Jan 07 02:02 <Reticuli1> (Y)
2014 Jan 07 02:02 <monofree> so... eta couple hours?
2014 Jan 07 02:02 <soulseekah> that's an ass
2014 Jan 07 02:02 <soulseekah> monofree: probably who knows
2014 Jan 07 02:02 <neferty> go to sleep, it should be up when you wake up :p
2014 Jan 07 02:02 <mancha> soulseekah: how long did the sieving run?
2014 Jan 07 02:02 <soulseekah> they said eta for merging would be 1 hour
2014 Jan 07 02:02 <soulseekah> but it was 1 minute
2014 Jan 07 02:02 <soulseekah> mancha: I'd say around 4 hours
2014 Jan 07 02:02 <soulseekah> amnot sure
2014 Jan 07 02:02 <soulseekah> lost track of time here, 7AM
2014 Jan 07 02:02 <mancha> then i would expect the linalg reductions and the square rooting to be within the hour.
2014 Jan 07 02:02 <soulseekah> the preparations took longer
2014 Jan 07 02:02 <neferty> i'd say about 4-5 hours with all the fucking around
2014 Jan 07 02:03 <Ymgve> how much cpu are you using?
2014 Jan 07 02:03 <neferty> plenty.
2014 Jan 07 02:03 <mancha> this is quite impressive a project. i shouldn't have gone out to buy supplies. fucking thing's over by the time i get back.
2014 Jan 07 02:03 <soulseekah> how many cores?
2014 Jan 07 02:03 <gumpus> any more distributed steps after this?
2014 Jan 07 02:03 <neferty> nope
2014 Jan 07 02:03 <neferty> well, who knows
2014 Jan 07 02:03 <neferty> we might get another factoring challenge
2014 Jan 07 02:04 <gumpus> so, would this have been doable by one person?
2014 Jan 07 02:04 <gumpus> this particular factorization, i mean
2014 Jan 07 02:04 <neferty> gumpus: well, with sufficient computational power, sure
2014 Jan 07 02:04 <mancha> good job to all those who put this distributed thing together. 
2014 Jan 07 02:04 <Reticuli1> These destributed stages is probably meant to be able to work in group
2014 Jan 07 02:04 <Reticuli1> And team up to complete a task
2014 Jan 07 02:04 <mancha> gumpus: it would have taken weeks.
2014 Jan 07 02:04 <gumpus> ok, that's what i was thinking 
2014 Jan 07 02:04 <soulseekah> unless GPU farm
2014 Jan 07 02:04 <neferty> gumpus: with your 32 core ec2, it would've taken a week or two probably
2014 Jan 07 02:04 <mancha> right. unless someone had a farm.
2014 Jan 07 02:04 <Ymgve> or ec2 farm
2014 Jan 07 02:05 <Reticuli1> Is it possible to do it with GPU soulseekah?
2014 Jan 07 02:05 <neferty> Reticuli1: there's a GPU cracker, but it's not distributed
2014 Jan 07 02:05 <soulseekah> yes
2014 Jan 07 02:05 <apx> soulseekah what is the prime?
2014 Jan 07 02:05 <soulseekah> msieve cuda
2014 Jan 07 02:05 <soulseekah> apx: no idea, we'll find out soon I guess
2014 Jan 07 02:05 <apx> oooh I'm curious
2014 Jan 07 02:05 <gumpus> i got msieve cuda going earlier today but my nvidia GPU sucks
2014 Jan 07 02:05 <mancha> who runs the server machine?
2014 Jan 07 02:05 <neferty> amazon ;)
2014 Jan 07 02:05 <soulseekah> I did msieve cude too
2014 Jan 07 02:06 <monofree> never been so excited waiting to know a number
2014 Jan 07 02:06 <mancha> i.e. who will announce "i can haz factorz" 
2014 Jan 07 02:06 <soulseekah> not luck after 2 hours on 100 digit number
2014 Jan 07 02:06 <gumpus> soulseekah: yeah, same experience
2014 Jan 07 02:06 <gumpus> gave up and started playing with cado 
2014 Jan 07 02:06 <mancha> i was doing ecm (elliptic curve) factorization.
2014 Jan 07 02:06 <gumpus> figured i could wrangle enough machines together, not enough to do it all in hours though.
2014 Jan 07 02:06 <soulseekah> yes cado is readily-available technology that allowed us to gather workers fast
2014 Jan 07 02:07 <soulseekah> msieve is not ready for distributed networks atm
2014 Jan 07 02:07 <soulseekah> there are save files and stuff but
2014 Jan 07 02:07 <gumpus> barely ready for cuda
2014 Jan 07 02:07 <monofree> isn't it quite certain that this is how the puzzle was meant to be solved, since they could have made the difficulty much harder very easily?
2014 Jan 07 02:07 <neferty> gumpus: we started around 2pm CEST... and it took a lot of setting up and testing, until like 8pm CEST that we got a working setup
2014 Jan 07 02:08 * Sherlockbox is now known as inabox
2014 Jan 07 02:08 <soulseekah> monofree: unless the www.1033.eu site has the factors there
2014 Jan 07 02:08 <gumpus> any of you guys familiar with cad- before this? 
2014 Jan 07 02:08 <soulseekah> in some ping shit
2014 Jan 07 02:08 <gumpus> cado*
2014 Jan 07 02:08 <neferty> monofree: given how previous years' first puzzles were teamwork, then later on individual work, likely
2014 Jan 07 02:08 <soulseekah> first time cado
2014 Jan 07 02:08 <gumpus> i'd never heard of it before
2014 Jan 07 02:08 <soulseekah> first time factoring actually
2014 Jan 07 02:08 <soulseekah> other than project euler
2014 Jan 07 02:08 <neferty> i heard about it but never used
2014 Jan 07 02:08 <gumpus> found it in a readme for msieve i think, or some webpage with msieve info on it
2014 Jan 07 02:09 <gumpus> soulseekah: yeah, same (first time factoring)
2014 Jan 07 02:09 <ilovebooze420> first time for me too
2014 Jan 07 02:09 <soulseekah> should I go to bed
2014 Jan 07 02:09 <gumpus> it's an interesting problem 
2014 Jan 07 02:09 <soulseekah> or should I go to bed not
2014 Jan 07 02:09 <crazy> I'm glad to have participate to this step, thanks to everybody work, especially to those who ran the server. Good night everybody.
2014 Jan 07 02:09 <mancha> do we have a ready perl script using Crypt::RSA to get this back once we have d?
2014 Jan 07 02:09 <eonn> soulseekah, please go ^^
2014 Jan 07 02:09 <gumpus> mancha: yeah think it's on the wiki 
2014 Jan 07 02:09 <neferty> mancha: yes, it's on wiki
2014 Jan 07 02:09 <soulseekah> I have python
2014 Jan 07 02:09 <soulseekah> script
2014 Jan 07 02:09 <soulseekah> using pycrypto
2014 Jan 07 02:09 <mancha> cool.
2014 Jan 07 02:09 <soulseekah> but this is 1/2 of the job
2014 Jan 07 02:09 <soulseekah> we still need d
2014 Jan 07 02:09 <mancha> not really.
2014 Jan 07 02:10 <mancha> Crypt::RSA will use p,q to decrypt.
2014 Jan 07 02:10 <soulseekah> do we know chosen d?
2014 Jan 07 02:10 <soulseekah> okay haven't looked into it much
2014 Jan 07 02:10 <soulseekah> I guess we'll see
2014 Jan 07 02:10 <gumpus> dont want to drift too far off topic - but are you guys cicada veterans from years prior?
2014 Jan 07 02:10 <soulseekah> RSA.construct( n, e, d, p, q )
2014 Jan 07 02:10 <apx> yes..
2014 Jan 07 02:10 <ilovebooze420> i watched last years, but didnt participate. this was my first time participating
2014 Jan 07 02:10 <soulseekah> I think 20% of here are from last year
2014 Jan 07 02:11 <gumpus> hmm, ok
2014 Jan 07 02:11 <gumpus> i found out about it a few months ago, was like 'damn why did i not hear about this??"
2014 Jan 07 02:11 <mancha> but once we have p,q then getting d is pretty simple. solve ed=1 (mod phi(p)phi(q))
2014 Jan 07 02:11 <fdsfgs> yeah
2014 Jan 07 02:11 <gumpus> so i've been waiting for the challenge to show up :) 
2014 Jan 07 02:11 <soulseekah> mancha: I see
2014 Jan 07 02:11 <soulseekah> anyway
2014 Jan 07 02:11 <neferty> http://pastebin.com/NrDwJait
2014 Jan 07 02:11 <soulseekah> off to bed guys
2014 Jan 07 02:12 <M3N74L157> You guys did really a great job, basically you a 0 day hack. shouldn't someone update the wiki about this?
2014 Jan 07 02:12 <mancha> if p,q turn out to be real primes (not a guarantee) then phi(p) and phi(q) are just p-1 and q-1
2014 Jan 07 02:12 <ilovebooze420> on a side note, im almost 100% sure the newton image from cicada did not exist online before cicada posted it. i cant find a pic with a high enough resolution. pretty sure it came from a reprint poster and pic was actually taken (and modified) by cicada
2014 Jan 07 02:12 <gumpus> night
2014 Jan 07 02:12 <mancha> which makes it even easier.
2014 Jan 07 02:12 <soulseekah> and
2014 Jan 07 02:12 <soulseekah> Hope to see an update with those primes tomorrow
2014 Jan 07 02:12 <soulseekah> ;)
2014 Jan 07 02:12 <soulseekah> Good work all
2014 Jan 07 02:12 <soulseekah> May Cicada be with you.
2014 Jan 07 02:12 <M3N74L157> night soulseekah
2014 Jan 07 02:12 * soulseekah is now known as soulseekah_away
2014 Jan 07 02:12 <mancha> soulseekah: if you're going to bed, who is going to update once the primes are found?
2014 Jan 07 02:12 <M3N74L157> but seriously, shouldn't this go into the wiki?
2014 Jan 07 02:12 <soulseekah_away> mancha: I don't own the server
2014 Jan 07 02:13 <soulseekah_away> this will be in the wiki
2014 Jan 07 02:13 <soulseekah_away> as soon as it's up
2014 Jan 07 02:13 <mancha> who will post it there?
2014 Jan 07 02:13 <M3N74L157> I mean, the actual state.
2014 Jan 07 02:13 <soulseekah_away> neferty and mdzhb own the server
2014 Jan 07 02:13 <neferty> mancha: either i or mdzhb 
2014 Jan 07 02:13 <soulseekah_away> they will
2014 Jan 07 02:13 <mancha> excellent. cheers man.
2014 Jan 07 02:13 * soulseekah_away off
2014 Jan 07 02:13 <mancha> good work with this initiative.
2014 Jan 07 02:13 <iuser_admin> so could we bruteforce the private key that cicada uses to sign their messages feasibly?
2014 Jan 07 02:13 <neferty> iuser_admin: not really, uses a much larger keysize
2014 Jan 07 02:13 <iuser_admin> yeah, figured
2014 Jan 07 02:13 <mancha> iuser_admin: that is a much larger key
2014 Jan 07 02:14 <neferty> something that couldn't be factored with all of humanity's computational power in the lifetime of the universe
2014 Jan 07 02:14 <neferty> in fact, that wouldn't come anywhere close
2014 Jan 07 02:14 <gumpus> unless p=np
2014 Jan 07 02:14 <neferty> well yeah...
2014 Jan 07 02:14 <gumpus> ;)
2014 Jan 07 02:14 <Reticuli1> Quantum computer might
2014 Jan 07 02:14 <mancha> in fact, their sig is 4096 bits (our exercise here is 430 bits)
2014 Jan 07 02:14 <mancha> it would take our distributed initiative about 3,400 years!  :)
2014 Jan 07 02:14 <neferty> and every bit doubles it etc....
2014 Jan 07 02:14 <mancha> or $long_time
2014 Jan 07 02:15 <Reticuli1> >1000 != cracked
2014 Jan 07 02:15 <ilovebooze420> google has a quantum just sitting around. lets see if we can borrow it (kidding, obviously)
2014 Jan 07 02:15 <neferty> ilovebooze420: the d-wave thing? it's bogus
2014 Jan 07 02:15 <gumpus> iirc those dwave machines can't be used for cracking public key 
2014 Jan 07 02:15 <mancha> google's quantum machine can't do shor's
2014 Jan 07 02:15 <gumpus> they won't run the algorithm for shor
2014 Jan 07 02:15 <mancha> but nsa is working on it....
2014 Jan 07 02:15 <gumpus> hey!
2014 Jan 07 02:15 <gumpus> nsa might have done it already
2014 Jan 07 02:16 <mancha> shor's will be a reality very soon, making everything (even rsa-4096) trivial to factor.
2014 Jan 07 02:16 <gumpus> nsa knew about public key crypto before it was published 
2014 Jan 07 02:16 <gumpus> we live in exciting times...
2014 Jan 07 02:16 <Reticuli1> They are a few years forward in time
2014 Jan 07 02:16 * JustVisiting is now known as JustSleeping
2014 Jan 07 02:17 <neferty> gumpus: you sure have a weird interpretation of exciting
2014 Jan 07 02:17 <gumpus> :)
2014 Jan 07 02:17 <neferty> i sure as fuck don't look forward to all of our security systems becoming obsolete
2014 Jan 07 02:17 <neferty> lols
2014 Jan 07 02:17 <JustSleeping> Gnite again, guys. Congrats, see you tomorrow.
2014 Jan 07 02:17 <ilovebooze420> seems you are correct neferty. d-wave is bogus

2014 Jan 07 03:32 <Surtri> did who
2014 Jan 07 03:32 <Surtri> bakpak?
2014 Jan 07 03:32 <Surtri> and kick everyone?
2014 Jan 07 03:32 <apx> yes
2014 Jan 07 03:32 <Surtri> Because of the raid/troll
2014 Jan 07 03:32 <Surtri> You missed so much I guess
2014 Jan 07 03:32 <po10> guess it was necessary
2014 Jan 07 03:32 <Surtri> It was ridiculous
2014 Jan 07 03:32 <Surtri> It was necessary
2014 Jan 07 03:33 <apx> hm. why are these trolls participating at all?
2014 Jan 07 03:33 <apx> I dont get it
2014 Jan 07 03:33 <Ymgve> because 4chan
2014 Jan 07 03:33 <po10> they are driven by their need to fuck with people
