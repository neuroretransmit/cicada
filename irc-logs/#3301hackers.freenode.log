2014 Jan 12 00:38 <L0j1k> hmmm
2014 Jan 12 00:38 <Ymgve> so...the pictures this time aren't just normal rune translations?
2014 Jan 12 00:38 <L0j1k> ymgve are you active in thsi channel?
2014 Jan 12 00:38 <L0j1k> haha
2014 Jan 12 00:38 <L0j1k> counterhash can you please repeat what you said for ymgve?
2014 Jan 12 00:39 <counterhash> See the second image: http://i.imgur.com/tuMSH2r.jpg
2014 Jan 12 00:39 <counterhash> If you take a look at the bottom paragraph, starting with the 'B' symbol
2014 Jan 12 00:39 <counterhash> Look along it, at the 13th character there we have a SINGLE LETTER
2014 Jan 12 00:39 <counterhash> This obviously translates to 'A', 3301 have never used 'I'
2014 Jan 12 00:39 <counterhash> Then go along, and at the end of the second line, there is an 'R' character, alone, again
2014 Jan 12 00:39 <counterhash> This also translates to 'A'
2014 Jan 12 00:39 <counterhash> We have to figure out the key, it is a shift cipher that goes along a string of numbers (not sure what called)
2014 Jan 12 00:40 <Ymgve> anyone transcribed it so far?
2014 Jan 12 00:40 <L0j1k> soulseekah is now asleep, otherwise he'd be interested... teefs, mancha, rr645, masso, if they're around
2014 Jan 12 00:40 <counterhash> Nope
2014 Jan 12 00:40 <counterhash> http://titanpad.com/I7tf8O9vTN
2014 Jan 12 00:40 <L0j1k> apparently the runes aren't transcribable like previous runes
2014 Jan 12 00:40 <counterhash> That's the current progress, they haven't gotten anywhere
2014 Jan 12 00:40 <counterhash> They aren't the same as the previous ones
2014 Jan 12 00:40 <L0j1k> though i'm working on hearsay with no ability to verify
2014 Jan 12 00:40 <rr645> L0j1k I'm barely around, laptop issues
2014 Jan 12 00:40 <counterhash> It's using a shift

2014 Jan 12 00:42 <teefs> unfortunate busy atm
2014 Jan 12 00:42 <counterhash> teefs: yeah. I've tried a bunch of stuff to no avail. It seems most of the letters we need are on a shift from their original position by a prime number (commonly 3, 7)
2014 Jan 12 00:43 <teefs> try 3301?
2014 Jan 12 00:43 <teefs> brb
2014 Jan 12 00:43 <counterhash> k
2014 Jan 12 00:44 <counterhash> 3301%29 (29 being the numbers of entries) = 24, which is -5 if we go the other way
2014 Jan 12 00:45 <Ymgve> so are anyone else working on transcribing the runes into an intermediary format_
2014 Jan 12 00:45 <counterhash> These guys: http://titanpad.com/I7tf8O9vTN
2014 Jan 12 00:46 <counterhash> They're transscribed them according to the previous rules
2014 Jan 12 00:46 <counterhash> Most of them
2014 Jan 12 00:46 <teefs> i mean 3301 as key u say each let shift by diff ammount maybe?
2014 Jan 12 00:47 <teefs> so first let +3, second +3 third +0 four +1 etc
2014 Jan 12 00:47 <counterhash> teefs: potentially, but it doesn't match up
2014 Jan 12 00:47 <counterhash> There should be another key...
2014 Jan 12 00:47 <counterhash> The grid, perhaps?
2014 Jan 12 00:47 <teefs> try num in matrix
2014 Jan 12 00:47 <teefs> yeah
2014 Jan 12 00:47 <counterhash> Anyone got the matrix
2014 Jan 12 00:47 <counterhash> ofc
2014 Jan 12 00:47 <teefs> or onion shit
2014 Jan 12 00:48 <counterhash> I'll grab the matrix
2014 Jan 12 00:48 <counterhash> btw there's another string which is definitely an onion

2014 Jan 12 00:48 <teefs> then go backwar from ther
2014 Jan 12 00:48 <counterhash> the last 4 chars are O N IO N
2014 Jan 12 00:49 <counterhash> okay, thanks
2014 Jan 12 00:49 <teefs> np
2014 Jan 12 00:51 <counterhash> hmmm, seems to work with the 13th char
2014 Jan 12 00:51 <counterhash> lemme try more
2014 Jan 12 00:53 <counterhash> It only works with the second one if we take the 13th char to be 'I'
2014 Jan 12 00:53 <counterhash> But how could it be?
2014 Jan 12 00:54 <counterhash> I will try more
2014 Jan 12 00:55 <counterhash> hmm. not working either.
2014 Jan 12 00:59 <masso> guys, question, did anyone manage to get outguess from the reversed pic?
2014 Jan 12 01:00 <counterhash> yes
2014 Jan 12 01:00 <counterhash> it didn't give anything

2014 Jan 12 01:12 <Taiiwo> What do you need them to do?
2014 Jan 12 01:13 <counterhash> Basically, with the runes I worked out that each letter is a shift through the runes table (probably)
2014 Jan 12 01:13 <counterhash> So you take a rune and shift it up a couple of spots on the table
2014 Jan 12 01:13 <counterhash> But we haven't worked out what those shift numbers are
2014 Jan 12 01:13 <Taiiwo> So like a runic caesar cipher.
2014 Jan 12 01:13 <counterhash> Pretty much, as far as we can discern
2014 Jan 12 01:14 <Taiiwo> Hmm
2014 Jan 12 01:14 <Taiiwo> Do we have no script to do this?

2014 Jan 12 01:21 <counterhash> idontworkfor3301, they're likely commas

2014 Jan 12 01:21 <counterhash> I'll set up a titanpad were we can work on this
2014 Jan 12 01:21 <Ymgve> I don't think it's a variable shift cipher, or the letter frequency would be more flat

2014 Jan 12 01:22 <counterhash> Ymgve: Perhaps
2014 Jan 12 01:22 <counterhash> We gotta work that out
2014 Jan 12 01:23 <idontworkfor3301> the red is one word
2014 Jan 12 01:23 <idontworkfor3301> can't be A Warning
2014 Jan 12 01:23 <teefs> if u have large enough sample u can take every n letter and check frequency
2014 Jan 12 01:23 <teefs> range over n
2014 Jan 12 01:23 <idontworkfor3301> Six/seven letters
2014 Jan 12 01:23 <teefs> when freq start to look english, that ur key length
2014 Jan 12 01:25 <counterhash> So what I worked on was taking the matrix values, performing [value]%[table length] on them, and counting upwards from the character
2014 Jan 12 01:25 <counterhash> I managed to get 'THE' after the first word, but nothing else after that
2014 Jan 12 01:25 <teefs> wher is reverse gematria
2014 Jan 12 01:25 <teefs> cant find
2014 Jan 12 01:25 <counterhash> http://static2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140108163161/uncovering-cicada/images/6/66/Runes-warning.jpg

2014 Jan 12 01:26 <counterhash> Not very high quality, missing numbers
2014 Jan 12 01:26 <idontworkfor3301> counterhash how did you get The?
2014 Jan 12 01:26 <counterhash> Idontworkfor3301, see what I said before it
2014 Jan 12 01:26 <counterhash> 272 138 341 131 151 366 199 130 320 18 226 245 91
2014 Jan 12 01:26 <idontworkfor3301> ah I see
2014 Jan 12 01:26 <counterhash> So the first character is at the same position as '199'
2014 Jan 12 01:26 <teefs> counterhash: take totient of 131 maybe
2014 Jan 12 01:26 <teefs> totient of all prime
2014 Jan 12 01:26 <teefs> try 130 instead?
2014 Jan 12 01:27 <teefs> 131 -> 130,  151 -> 150,  199 -> 198
2014 Jan 12 01:27 <counterhash> hmm, perhaps
2014 Jan 12 01:27 <teefs> the first letter u say it mess up is 4, correspond to 131
2014 Jan 12 01:28 <counterhash> So that would make the first letter 'S'
2014 Jan 12 01:29 <teefs> the s ?
2014 Jan 12 01:29 <counterhash> no wait
2014 Jan 12 01:29 <counterhash> So take that rune which looks like 'R'
2014 Jan 12 01:29 <counterhash> It's at the same position as '199'
2014 Jan 12 01:29 <counterhash> 198%29 = 24
2014 Jan 12 01:29 <masso> not s imho...
2014 Jan 12 01:29 <counterhash> Count up 24 spots from the 'R' on the table
2014 Jan 12 01:30 <counterhash> Sorry it's not S
2014 Jan 12 01:30 <counterhash> Basically, we have to work out how to get from that 'R' to whatever it's likely to equal
2014 Jan 12 01:31 <counterhash> I'd say that first thing is 'THE', but how we get there is anyone's guess
2014 Jan 12 01:32 <counterhash> Actually scratch that it's unlikely to be THE because of the 'TH' character
2014 Jan 12 01:33 * absence_|_away is now known as absence_
2014 Jan 12 01:34 <counterhash> absence_: Read everything above, we need help
2014 Jan 12 01:35 <absence_> starting where
2014 Jan 12 01:36 <counterhash> Where Idontworkfor3301 joined
2014 Jan 12 01:38 <absence_> ive been ghosted for the last few days, injury & sickness so im not caught up on this rune shit/ciphers
2014 Jan 12 01:38 <counterhash> Yeah, it's difficult
2014 Jan 12 01:38 <counterhash> Hope you're okay
2014 Jan 12 01:38 <absence_> nothing big dont worry
2014 Jan 12 01:38 <absence_> so have u converted these runes to text?
2014 Jan 12 01:39 <absence_> or is that not how it works?
2014 Jan 12 01:39 <absence_> lol
2014 Jan 12 01:39 <counterhash> Basically, we're trying to convert them to text
2014 Jan 12 01:40 <counterhash> The problem is is that we don't know what shifts to work off
2014 Jan 12 01:40 <counterhash> I had people in here before but they've all seemed to have cleared out
2014 Jan 12 01:40 <Ymgve> I'm here, partially
2014 Jan 12 01:41 <counterhash> k thanks ymgve :)

2014 Jan 12 01:43 <idontworkfor3301> Hear me out counterhash I'm thinking it may be a Y = x + loc[x ] + B transformation (Y is correct rune, X is original rune, B is offset, and loc[x] is an array of each word returning the position of x in the string)
2014 Jan 12 01:43 <idontworkfor3301> Reasoning: We have a 2 letter word that uses the same letter... So each letter has to have its own variable
2014 Jan 12 01:44 <absence_> greetings Ymgve glad to see you
2014 Jan 12 01:44 <idontworkfor3301> based either on its position in the string, or another variable
2014 Jan 12 01:44 <counterhash> idontworkfor3301: We also have a 3 letter word that starts with a double letter. No such thing.
2014 Jan 12 01:44 <counterhash> I think it might be based on its position in the sentence, or perhaps the paragraph
2014 Jan 12 01:44 <counterhash> idontworkfor3301: any idea on 'B'
2014 Jan 12 01:45 <counterhash> "Let the text guide you" - 3001
2014 Jan 12 01:45 <counterhash> *3301
2014 Jan 12 01:45 <counterhash> I think they meant we're supposed to solve what the text could mean first and then find out how to create that
2014 Jan 12 01:46 <idontworkfor3301> no idea on B...
2014 Jan 12 01:46 <absence_> question
2014 Jan 12 01:46 <counterhash> yep
2014 Jan 12 01:46 <absence_> are we trying to keep this room more private than the rest?
2014 Jan 12 01:46 <masso> ya, I think we need both texts to solve the onion address
2014 Jan 12 01:46 <iIIustrious> only cuz it was nice to have it quiet absence_
2014 Jan 12 01:46 <absence_> okay
2014 Jan 12 01:46 <iIIustrious> it's not a big secret or anything
2014 Jan 12 01:46 <idontworkfor3301> I'm about to grab dinner, afterwards I can start coding a C# program to brute force some Y = x + loc[x] + B formulas
2014 Jan 12 01:47 <iIIustrious> also as it's away from the g+ers suggestions :p
2014 Jan 12 01:47 <counterhash> idontworkfor3301: Thanks
2014 Jan 12 01:47 <absence_> people have made #cicadatranslation
2014 Jan 12 01:47 <absence_> to dedicate xlate efforts
2014 Jan 12 01:47 <absence_> \o/
2014 Jan 12 01:47 <iIIustrious> cool
2014 Jan 12 01:47 <absence_> i dont know their quality of work
2014 Jan 12 01:47 <counterhash> absence_: The work they've been doing hasn't exactly helped with anything
2014 Jan 12 01:47 <absence_> okay
2014 Jan 12 01:47 <counterhash> The literally sat silent in that piratepad room, haven't tried anything
2014 Jan 12 01:48 <absence_> just informing
2014 Jan 12 01:48 <counterhash> I've joined to follow along anyway, jsut in case
2014 Jan 12 01:48 <counterhash> Lot of three letter words in the last paragraph
2014 Jan 12 01:49 <absence_> will be reading the last rune translation to see how it worked.
2014 Jan 12 01:49 <counterhash> absence_: Cool, keep in mind it IS a cipher applied to the runes
2014 Jan 12 01:50 <counterhash> I'd say these runes have a known cipher applied to them
2014 Jan 12 01:50 <counterhash> Perhaps it is a transposition again?
2014 Jan 12 01:51 <counterhash> It could also be a railfence
2014 Jan 12 01:52 <counterhash> Hmm, someone has a rune font: ᚢᛠᛝᛋᛇᚠᚳ ᚱᛇᚢᚷᛈᛠᛠ ᚠᚹᛉᛏᚳᛚᛠ ᚣᛗ ᛠᛇ ᛏᚳᚾᚫ ᛝᛗᛡᛡᛗᛗᚹ ᚫᛈᛞᛝᛡᚱ ᚩᛠ ᛡᛗᛁ ᚠᚠ ᛖᚢᛝ ᛇᚢᚫ ᚣᛈ ᚱᚫ ᛁᛈᚫ ᚳᚫ ᚫᚾᚹ ᛒᛉᛗᛞᚱᛡᛁ ᚠᛈᚳ ᛇᛇᚫᚳ ᚱᚦᛈ ᚠᛄᛗᚩ ᛇᚳᚹᛡ ᛒᚫᚹ ᛒᛠᛚᛋ ᚱᚣ ᛄᚫ ᚱ ᛗᚳᚦᛇᛏᚳᛈᚹ ᛗᚷᛇ

2014 Jan 12 01:54 <iIIustrious> boxes here too
2014 Jan 12 01:54 <iIIustrious> stupid shit client
2014 Jan 12 01:54 <absence_> just copy paste to notepad
2014 Jan 12 01:54 <absence_> it works then
2014 Jan 12 01:54 <teefs> i see runes

2014 Jan 12 01:55 <teefs> v faint
2014 Jan 12 01:56 <teefs> is too late
2014 Jan 12 01:56 <counterhash> An update on #cicadatranslation: They seem to have gathered that there's a variable shift cipher involved
2014 Jan 12 01:56 <Ymgve> I think we should stick to the translation in the original gematria instead of pasting runes!
2014 Jan 12 01:56 <teefs> dot have energy to transcrib this out
2014 Jan 12 01:56 <counterhash> Ymgve: yep

2014 Jan 12 01:59 <Lurker69> who PMd me three minutes ago something regarding wiki? can you please PM me again i lost thr PM
2014 Jan 12 02:00 <masso> >lost pm
2014 Jan 12 02:01 <Lurker69> counterhash: are you identified?
2014 Jan 12 02:01 <Lurker69> masso: idk, i had notification but no window is purple?!?
2014 Jan 12 02:01 <counterhash> I think so
2014 Jan 12 02:02 <counterhash> Yeah I'm identified
2014 Jan 12 02:02 <Lurker69> counterhash: on then i can close countersleep PM, i wonder who he was
2014 Jan 12 02:02 <counterhash> oh thats weird
2014 Jan 12 02:04 <masso> Lurker69: that can be a notification from chan too
2014 Jan 12 02:05 <masso> when someone called you
2014 Jan 12 02:05 <counterhash> I have used the nick countersleep before
2014 Jan 12 02:05 <counterhash> It's possible a message I sent just went through
2014 Jan 12 02:05 <Lurker69> yeah i know but none chan nor PM is putple
2014 Jan 12 02:06 <Lurker69> and i am ctrl-f for only eord in it #confusing" but not finfind it anywhere :-(
2014 Jan 12 02:09 <counterhash> For ONION I got the offsets (going downwards) of 13, 26, 27, 11
2014 Jan 12 02:09 <counterhash> Interesting that 13*2 = 26
2014 Jan 12 02:09 <counterhash> And 26+1 = 27
2014 Jan 12 02:09 <counterhash> But (27*2)%29 != 11
2014 Jan 12 02:16 <masso> well fuck... I'm bad in things like this :(
2014 Jan 12 02:16 <counterhash> I think everyone in here is
2014 Jan 12 02:18 <absence_> to high right now

2014 Jan 12 02:30 <masso> well guys, I'll drop the runes and have a look into the second outguess
2014 Jan 12 02:31 <absence_> can u link 2nd outguess
2014 Jan 12 02:34 <masso> absence_: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=bmESdaSt

2014 Jan 12 02:35 <masso> text is out of ascii mostly
2014 Jan 12 02:47 <idontworkfor3301> Any update in the past 45 minutes? I've begun making the brute force program

2014 Jan 12 05:16 <Lurker69> IMPORTANT
2014 Jan 12 05:16 <Lurker69> IMPORTANT
2014 Jan 12 05:16 <Lurker69> [05:13] <Lurker69> yup
2014 Jan 12 05:16 <Lurker69> [05:13] <Lurker69> we are loosing incredible amount of smat ppl
2014 Jan 12 05:16 <Lurker69> [05:14] <Lurker69> becasue some faggots are creating secret chans instead of using alt chans
2014 Jan 12 05:16 <Lurker69> [05:14] <Lurker69> today we had artcles in BBS anf the guardian
2014 Jan 12 05:16 <Lurker69> [05:14] <masso> only because some ppl give a fuck about cocada this year and are 98% afk, but fuck up everything in the 2%
2014 Jan 12 05:16 <Lurker69> [05:14] <Lurker69> we got like 2000 people interested in this ,  so much that they check wikia nd irc
2014 Jan 12 05:16 <Lurker69> [05:15] <Lurker69> 50 of them are smart i am sure of this
2014 Jan 12 05:16 <Lurker69> [05:15] <Lurker69> and we are loosing them becasue mai nchan is dumb
2014 Jan 12 05:16 <Lurker69> [05:15] <iIIustrious> we definately need a better way to organize this
2014 Jan 12 05:16 <Lurker69> [05:15] <masso> ya, and bak gives a fuck about anything and only messes thing s up
2014 Jan 12 05:16 <Lurker69> [05:15] <Lurker69> i wll add al secret channels in wikia
2014 Jan 12 05:16 <Lurker69> [05:15] <Lurker69> ok?
2014 Jan 12 05:16 <Lurker69> [05:15] <iIIustrious> yes
2014 Jan 12 05:21 <teefs> y
2014 Jan 12 05:21 <teefs> it will be shitflood in here too
2014 Jan 12 05:21 <idontworkfor3301> This is i+ right?
2014 Jan 12 05:21 <iIIustrious> no
2014 Jan 12 05:21 <Lurker69> we are loosing smart people becasue main schats look like kindergarde
2014 Jan 12 05:21 <idontworkfor3301> Don't just let anyone in here
2014 Jan 12 05:21 <teefs> now it is i gues
2014 Jan 12 05:21 <Lurker69> and no real progress is done there
2014 Jan 12 05:21 <iIIustrious> it's open from last year
2014 Jan 12 05:22 <idontworkfor3301> I don't even read #33012014 anymore
2014 Jan 12 05:22 <idontworkfor3301> Cicadasolvers has become the new semi-offtopic chan
2014 Jan 12 05:22 <Lurker69> #cicada3301  channel is posted in topic and it is DEAD
2014 Jan 12 05:22 <Lurker69> #cicada3301 channel is posted in topic and it is DEAD
2014 Jan 12 05:22 <Lurker69> Y ARE YOU NOT USING IT
2014 Jan 12 05:22 <Lurker69> I will rework wikia part with links to IRC
2014 Jan 12 05:22 <teefs> easier to talk in small channel
2014 Jan 12 05:23 <Lurker69> t make sure what is for newbiesand what for real work
2014 Jan 12 05:23 <Lurker69> i will make some rules "dont ask anyting, before you googled it and investigated for an hour"
2014 Jan 12 05:23 <Lurker69> teefs: yes easier
2014 Jan 12 05:24 <teefs> main problem this chan is no founder
2014 Jan 12 05:24 <Lurker69> but w e lost like 20 smart ppl today becasue  all main channels llok either like desert or like kindergarde
2014 Jan 12 05:24 <teefs> so if ppl find out and is problem, no auto op
2014 Jan 12 05:24 <teefs> except a cuple
2014 Jan 12 05:24 <Lurker69> and we had BBC and the guardian article
2014 Jan 12 05:24 <teefs> yeah
2014 Jan 12 05:24 <teefs> i understand
2014 Jan 12 05:24 <Lurker69> thosands of people chacked wiki and some of them IRC
2014 Jan 12 05:24 <Lurker69> iam sure many abandined IRC sore retardeness
2014 Jan 12 05:25 <Lurker69> so poeple are now making thise facbok gotup
2014 Jan 12 05:25 <Lurker69> and g* group
2014 Jan 12 05:25 <Lurker69> and piratepad group
2014 Jan 12 05:25 <Lurker69> ...
2014 Jan 12 05:25 <Lurker69> thats only reason
2014 Jan 12 05:25 <teefs> makes sense
2014 Jan 12 05:26 <Lurker69> splintering only leads to more splintering, and wehn our wiki will become outdated, we will lost all controll
2014 Jan 12 05:26 <teefs> yea #33012014 is full & dead
2014 Jan 12 05:26 <Lurker69> and it iwll just turn to zalgo
2014 Jan 12 05:26 <Lurker69> :-)
2014 Jan 12 05:26 <Lurker69> #cicada 3301 is dead for a week
2014 Jan 12 05:26 <Lurker69> all this secret gropus could be solving puzzle there
2014 Jan 12 05:27 <Lurker69> anyway i will rewrite all this rant for wikia and maek new IRC links
2014 Jan 12 05:31 <teefs> i bang my head against this cipher for over an hour straight
2014 Jan 12 05:31 <teefs> stupid cause half asleep
2014 Jan 12 05:33 <idontworkfor3301> same teefs
2014 Jan 12 05:33 <idontworkfor3301> I'm going to sleep soon
2014 Jan 12 05:35 <iIIustrious> if we want to keep this quiet, we can do what we did last year
2014 Jan 12 05:35 <iIIustrious> have it -m and you have to msg the answer to a really simple scriptable question to an op to talk
2014 Jan 12 05:43 <teefs> is that what happen
2014 Jan 12 05:43 <teefs> idr really
2014 Jan 12 05:44 <iIIustrious> I can't remember what the question was last year, but it got dropped from the topic some time mid year
2014 Jan 12 05:45 <teefs> somethin about wet bread probably lol
2014 Jan 12 05:47 <idontworkfor3301> :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
2014 Jan 12 05:48 <idontworkfor3301> :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
2014 Jan 12 05:56 <idontworkfor3301> I reall really thought I had it
2014 Jan 12 05:56 <idontworkfor3301> :(((
2014 Jan 12 05:56 <idontworkfor3301> I translated two words
2014 Jan 12 05:56 <idontworkfor3301> and the third was jumbled
2014 Jan 12 05:56 <iIIustrious> awww
2014 Jan 12 05:57 <idontworkfor3301> Unless encryption changes each line :/
2014 Jan 12 05:57 <mancha> folks, something bothers me...
2014 Jan 12 05:58 <iIIustrious> ?
2014 Jan 12 05:58 <mancha> first jpg, 3rd line, last word. it's a two-letter word where the letters repeat.
2014 Jan 12 05:58 <mancha> anyone know an english word like that?
2014 Jan 12 05:58 <teefs> it not monoalphabetic substitution
2014 Jan 12 05:59 <teefs> or else . are not spaces
2014 Jan 12 05:59 <iIIustrious> yeah
2014 Jan 12 05:59 <iIIustrious> one of those two
2014 Jan 12 05:59 <teefs> that seem p clear
2014 Jan 12 05:59 <mancha> right.
2014 Jan 12 05:59 <idontworkfor3301> I was JUST translating that.... I figured length of word + letter position with turns that into OR
2014 Jan 12 05:59 <idontworkfor3301> and it turns the word before it into THAT
2014 Jan 12 05:59 <idontworkfor3301> THAT OR
2014 Jan 12 05:59 <idontworkfor3301> but then I tried doing a third word, and got a jumbled mess
2014 Jan 12 06:00 <mancha> polygraphic will be hard...
2014 Jan 12 06:00 <teefs> mancha: some things i been thinkin...
2014 Jan 12 06:00 <idontworkfor3301> I thought I had gotten lucky
2014 Jan 12 06:00 <teefs> after fuck with stupid cipher
2014 Jan 12 06:01 <teefs> all gematira #s are prime, 3301 has reference totient overtly, this cant be coincidence
2014 Jan 12 06:01 <mancha> ok
2014 Jan 12 06:01 <teefs> some appl of euler's theorem, or fermats...we got all these primes
2014 Jan 12 06:02 <mancha> one of those is the special case of the other.
2014 Jan 12 06:02 <teefs> yep
2014 Jan 12 06:02 <mancha> if you mean fermat's *little* theorem (which i think you do)
2014 Jan 12 06:02 <teefs> ofc
2014 Jan 12 06:03 <teefs> i did not think had to specify that
2014 Jan 12 06:04 <mancha> ok, this is a good idea...to think in terms of the primes each rune is associated with....let me think about it a bit...
2014 Jan 12 06:04 <teefs> could find inverse modulo p some p, for each #
2014 Jan 12 06:04 <teefs> maybe p from matrix
2014 Jan 12 06:05 <teefs> inverse perhaps is our decrypted #
2014 Jan 12 06:05 <mancha> now you're cookin' with peanut oil...
2014 Jan 12 06:06 <teefs> idk these small #s so it all fast to do
2014 Jan 12 06:06 <teefs> hrm
2014 Jan 12 06:06 <teefs> well wat r u thinkin then
2014 Jan 12 06:06 <mancha> what's the role of the strip?
2014 Jan 12 06:06 <mancha> that was my way of saying good thinking. "cookin' with peanut oil" is a good thing
2014 Jan 12 06:06 <iIIustrious> if it weren't for the numbers I'd try it as a running key
2014 Jan 12 06:07 <teefs> could be running key too
2014 Jan 12 06:07 <teefs> diff modulus each number, repeating
2014 Jan 12 06:09 <teefs> mancha: idk what strip u mean?
2014 Jan 12 06:09 <teefs> the outguess?
2014 Jan 12 06:09 <mancha> yes
2014 Jan 12 06:10 <teefs> at first i thought onion...now not sure
2014 Jan 12 06:10 <teefs> maybe key?
2014 Jan 12 06:10 <mancha> it's 20 chars, right?
2014 Jan 12 06:10 <teefs> yes
2014 Jan 12 06:13 <L0j1k> uhhh
2014 Jan 12 06:13 <L0j1k> please please don't add this channel to the wikia
2014 Jan 12 06:13 <L0j1k> Lurker69
2014 Jan 12 06:14 <Lurker69> ya
2014 Jan 12 06:14 <Lurker69> hmmm
2014 Jan 12 06:14 <L0j1k> others, fine
2014 Jan 12 06:14 <mancha> oh boy. it was added? now we have to make a new one and +i it
2014 Jan 12 06:14 <Lurker69> have you seen my latest addition to wikia?

2014 Jan 12 06:14 <L0j1k> but this is the ONLY channel that has almost no noise
2014 Jan 12 06:15 <Lurker69> but yeah i can keep this one secret
2014 Jan 12 06:15 <mancha> too late.
2014 Jan 12 06:15 <mancha> if you added it then many will have seen it....
2014 Jan 12 06:15 <Lurker69> not too late
2014 Jan 12 06:15 <Lurker69> i havet added any channels yet
2014 Jan 12 06:15 <iIIustrious> guys read what he posted
2014 Jan 12 06:15 <L0j1k> thank god you didn't add this one
2014 Jan 12 06:15 <iIIustrious> it's only a descpription of the main ones
2014 Jan 12 06:15 <L0j1k> solvers is pretty on task
2014 Jan 12 06:15 <Lurker69> but insted of using this one we could use ops...
2014 Jan 12 06:15 <iIIustrious> sometimes
2014 Jan 12 06:16 <Lurker69> or not you are right
2014 Jan 12 06:16 <L0j1k> i think that's fair to the people who want to get away from spam
2014 Jan 12 06:16 <Lurker69> but just keep in mind!
2014 Jan 12 06:16 <Lurker69> not tio use only this channel
2014 Jan 12 06:16 <Lurker69> becasue we are loosing many poelpe
2014 Jan 12 06:16 <Lurker69> i lost contact to CW
2014 Jan 12 06:16 <L0j1k> i didn't
2014 Jan 12 06:16 <Lurker69> millitary pilot that solved columnar trasnposition
2014 Jan 12 06:16 <iIIustrious> it's normally only really used to talk about things being scripted etc, the info gained is always talked about in main chans
2014 Jan 12 06:16 <L0j1k> yeah
2014 Jan 12 06:16 <L0j1k> i didn't
2014 Jan 12 06:16 <Lurker69> cool :-)
2014 Jan 12 06:17 <Lurker69> bring him to otp22
2014 Jan 12 06:17 <Lurker69> also that assnage video i added
2014 Jan 12 06:17 <iIIustrious> is a good video
2014 Jan 12 06:17 <L0j1k> this is the only place i feel comfortable talking about drawing-board ideas before posting some conclusions in other channels
2014 Jan 12 06:17 <L0j1k> the other channels are full of rageball noobies who nitpick every little stupid thing in their quest for acceptance
2014 Jan 12 06:17 <Lurker69>  ifelt like i have to add something to disstract people, to stop and thing  for 2 min before that start trolling IRC chans
2014 Jan 12 06:18 <L0j1k> it's a good set of guidelines
2014 Jan 12 06:18 <Lurker69> not sure if it is too much political propaganda or not
2014 Jan 12 06:18 <L0j1k> but yeah, i told CW all about otp22
2014 Jan 12 06:18 <L0j1k> he wasn't sure if he'd come back to cicada, but he sounded interested in otp22
2014 Jan 12 06:18 <Lurker69> those BBC and other journalistic faggots will surely put too much attention to it
2014 Jan 12 06:18 <Lurker69> but i like every kid to waatch it before hestarts wiht how to convert binary to hex questions
2014 Jan 12 06:19 <Lurker69> and i like what JA said
2014 Jan 12 06:19 <Lurker69> small fracion of population attrcted to *roamntic* ides of absolute transparency at al costs, are main guidelines of this channel
2014 Jan 12 06:20 <Lurker69> i never thought hat guy like hyden can write such nice sentence :-p
2014 Jan 12 06:21 <mancha> You know how the media loves to write stories about "the dark net" and how it is used by pedophiles and terrorists? etc. when they describe tor?
2014 Jan 12 06:21 <mancha> because they don't know any better?
2014 Jan 12 06:21 <Lurker69> have you heard latets radio show
2014 Jan 12 06:21 <teefs> they know bettr, ppl know exaclty what they doin
2014 Jan 12 06:21 <Lurker69> mentions CP and  terrorist as main users of steganography :-P
2014 Jan 12 06:21 <teefs> they compromise isa ll
2014 Jan 12 06:21 <teefs> Lurker69: who?
2014 Jan 12 06:21 <mancha> linking cicada to assange (by putting assange stuff on the wiki) is a great way for the media to start linking this puzzle/game to a very controversial and political person who many people dislike.
2014 Jan 12 06:22 <teefs> ugh yea

2014 Jan 12 06:22 <Lurker69> no t sure i right link
2014 Jan 12 06:22 <mancha> i don't see any reason to have assange on the wiki unless it is a clue for the puzzle.
2014 Jan 12 06:22 <iIIustrious> lurker playing the politcal game :D
2014 Jan 12 06:22 <Lurker69> it is i think
2014 Jan 12 06:22 * Lurker69 lurker misses wikileaks chat
2014 Jan 12 06:23 <teefs> mancha: he on the wiki?
2014 Jan 12 06:23 <teefs> an image?
2014 Jan 12 06:23 <mancha> didn't lurker just say he posted a link to an assange video on the wiki?
2014 Jan 12 06:23 <teefs> missed that
2014 Jan 12 06:23 <Lurker69> mancha: yes for  first time visitors before thy sjoin any chat
2014 Jan 12 06:23 <Lurker69> not for people who are solving anyhitng
2014 Jan 12 06:24 <teefs> im not think it good to associate us with assange

2014 Jan 12 06:25 <Lurker69> my initial idea was to make new wikai for 2014, bbut most oldfags dissagreed
2014 Jan 12 06:25 <mancha> yes, but i don't like assange being posted in a place i post to.
2014 Jan 12 06:25 <teefs> and ppl change what it all about (game) to what they want make it about (cf. Anonymoose)
2014 Jan 12 06:26 <Lurker69> saying that new  one is good and it has many links
2014 Jan 12 06:26 <mancha> Before you join any of IRC channels look at few minutes of this video, if you dont agree with things guy says at 21:15, you are most probaly not it the right place.
2014 Jan 12 06:26 <Lurker69> which is tru
2014 Jan 12 06:26 <Lurker69> if only we would hane adming privs it would all be fine
2014 Jan 12 06:26 <mancha> teefs: that's the post. and it has a link to assange speaking.
2014 Jan 12 06:26 <teefs> hrm
2014 Jan 12 06:27 <Lurker69> i can put fideo of nevergonna give you up if you want
2014 Jan 12 06:27 <teefs> lol
2014 Jan 12 06:27 <Lurker69> i put accange only for the quote about transparenc
